far
afield
from
what
we
'd
come
to
understand
in

scream

.

the

in
the
silli
habit
of
say
``
all

''

in
refer
to
the
``
rule
''
of
a
trilog
's
third
act
,
but
there
's
a
differ
between
rule
break
and
cheat
.

with
the
departur
of
kevin
williamson
,
who
author
the
previou
scream
as
well
as
a
tidi
outlin
for
scream

-lrb-
that
,
for
reason
incomprehens
to

save
the
notion
of
``

''
-rrb-
,
kruger
need
to
be
rein
in
tighter
,
and
by
we
craven
.

craven
's
direct
of
scream

is
lazi
in
most
respect
.

how
els
to
explain
the
jay
and
silent
bob
cameo
-lrb-
the
slacker
duo
of
kevin
smith
movi
-rrb-
,
akin
to
see
mickey
mous
pop
up
in
mulan
and
more
distract
than
funni
.

It
pain
me
to
write
thi
,
but
scream
3
's
comedi
is
gener
laughless
,
with
the
except
of
well-tim
perform
by
josh
pai
-lrb-
as
a
polic
detect
possess
of
the

he

the

much
weaker
in

,
as

here
,
they
act
as

I
look
at
scream

as
come
from
an

,
the
same
place
that

scream
