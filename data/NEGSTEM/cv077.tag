romance-a
dull
,
unattract
teen
comedi
that
stick
to
the
bore
game
plan
that
we

thi
is
the
kind
of
romanc
that
onli

will
find
convinc
.

they
hit
it
off
like
a

from

,
it

the
standard
boy-meets-girl
,
boy-loses-girl

the

fortun
,
the
cast
of
`
down

ha
a
certain
appeal
.

freddi
prinz

and
julia
stile
are
an
ador
coupl
,
and
when
on
screen
togeth
,
they
radiat
the
sort
of
warmth
and
charisma
that
the
movi
should
have
center
around
.

even

the

a
welcom
role
as
Al
's
dad
,
the
host
of
the
popular
cook
program
`
chef
ray
'
.

mayb
the
concept
of
`
down
to
you
'
look
good
on
paper
to
draw
such
a
crowd
.

As
a
featur
film
,
howev
,
the
finish
product
is
bland
and
tasteless
fluff
with
onli
an
occasion
whiff
of
cute
to
keep
the
gear
from
stop
entir
.

perhap
worst
of
all
,
`
down
to
you
'
is
not
funni
.

the
joke
are
drawn
from
obviou
sourc
and
the
result
humor
is
banal
and
uninspir
.

the
charact
on
screen
,
often
laugh
at
each
other
's
goofy/embarrass
antic
,
seem
far
more
amus
than
the
audienc
.

even
the
giggli
12-year
old
girl
had
grown
restless
toward
the
end
as
they
wait
impati
for
the
formula
to
run
it
's
cours
.

the
one
mildli
clever
segment
featur
winkler
and
prinz
jr.
in
a
fantasi
sequenc
call
`
cook
'
,
a
`
cop
'
take-off
in
which
the
father
and
son
would
storm
hous
and
cook
a
decent
meal
for
needi
'
famili
-lrb-
with
the
assist
of
a
fully-arm
swat
team
,
of
cours
-rrb-
.

when
thi
is
the
highlight
reel
,
you
know
the
remain
film
could
leav
someth
to
be
desir
.

In
order
to
make
a
teen
comedi
work
,
you
've
got
to
have
charact
that
show
someth
by
way
of
depth
and
ident
.

`
10
thing
I
hate
about
you
'
actual
featur
charact
who
were
more
than
walk
flashcard
,
and
the
result
wa
refresh
.

No
such
luck
with
`
down
to
you
'
.

It
's
just
a
textbook
romanc
where
,
despit
absurd
circumst
,
everyth
is
bound
to
work
out
in
the
end
.

and
at
the
end
of
the
whole
clichd
ordeal
,
the
nicest
thing
you
could
possibl
say
would
be
`
...
.

onli
in
the
