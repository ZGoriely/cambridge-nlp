M
:
i-2
,
the
sequel
to
mission
imposs
,
is
a
jame
bond
wannab
film
,
but
it
fail
to
even
come
close
to
that
film
in
wit
,
humor
,
and
entertain
valu
.

It
tri
to
be
a
spy/rom
movi
,
but
without
ani
suspens
the
film
just
look
like
it
's
an
extend
commerci
for
dude
who
think
they
look
cool
in
throwaway
sunglass
.

It
is
a
film
that
prefer
techi
gadget
to
anyth
human
.

the
coolest
thing
about
thi
movi
,
wa
all
the
hole
it
had
in
it
stori
and
the
most
trite
thing
about
the
movi
,
wa
the
usag
of
dove
throughout
as
peac
symbol
.

the
film
play
as
if
it
wa
a
wet
fantasi
dream
about
techi
violenc
.

except
for
the
choreograph
action
sequenc
,
the
film
wa
dull
for
three-quart
of
it
time
,
fill
with
too
mani
dead
spot
in
it
stori
to
garner
concern
about
it
wooden
charact
or
the
superfici
romanc
that
develop
.

As
for
the
action
scene
,
they
might
look
good
to
those
who
are
convert
to
violenc
in
their
film
,
but
their
advertis
for
sadist
respons
,
is
noth
short
of
mindless
cartoon
violenc
,
which
make
it
veri
difficult
to
sit
back
and
applaud
without
feel
put
off
by
the
gratuit
cruelti
seen
.

M
:
i-2
open
and
close
with
fast-pac
action
scene
,
but
it
is
hard
to
get
past
the
middl
part
which
just
drag
on
in
banal
dialogu
.

the
film
look
as
if
it
had
been
invad
by
a
comput
viru
,
at
that
point
.

the
onli
thing
that
kept
me
awak
,
wa
the
horribl
music
compos
by
han
zimmer
that
becam
veri
loud
at
ani
of
the
film
's
supposedli
moment
action
scene
and
seem
to
make
an
uninterest
scene
even
more
notic
in
the
wrong
way
.

It
's
a
mega-buck
film
adapt
from
a
popular
high-tech
gadgetri
TV
seri
.

but
it
artist
success
is
an
imposs
task
to
accomplish
becaus
it
hire
the
wrong
director
and
actor
to
star
in
it
,
and
it
fail
to
produc
a
stori
that
had
ani
substanc
.

john
woo
-lrb-
``
broken
arrow
''
/
``
face/off
''
-rrb-
is
good
at
do
car
chase
,
choreograph
fight
with
midair
flip
and
kung-fu
kick
,
slo-mo
shot
of
two
gun
blaze
,
and
of
fire
explos
,
but
he
just
ca
n't
seem
to
handl
dialogu
and
suspens
.

the
star
of
the
film
and
co-produc
,
tom
cruis
,
and
hi
romant
interest
,
thandi
newton
,
are
miscast
.

cruis
is
no
jame
bond
and
look
more
like
a
yuppi
than
a
superhero
in
hi
stylish
long
hair
and
innocu
smile
,
as
he
tri
to
carri
off
thi
macho
role
,
while
thandi
is
not
an
action-film
girl
,
and
seem
like
a
fish-out-of-wat
in
thi
one
.

their
romanc
did
n't
work
,
not
onli
wa
it
tepid
and
not
sexi
,
but
it
wa
n't
convinc
.

the
film
open
with
dizzi
speed
,
perhap
with
the
hope
that
a
befuddl
audienc
is
it
best
bet
for
success
.

We
will
be
in
three
differ
locat
instantan
:
sydney
,
the
american
southwest
,
and
sevil
.

first
,
we
are
in
sydney
,
australia
,
where
a
scientist
with
a
muffl
russian
accent
,
dr.
nekhorvich
-lrb-
rade
-rrb-
,
mention
that
he
creat
a
deadli
killer
viru
call
chimera
and
an
antidot
for
it
.

He
also
mention
that
everi
hero
need
a
worthi
villain
.

which
explain
the
film
's
mythic
theme
...
as
we
enter
the
world
of
comic
book
myth
on
good
and
evil
.

the
one
who
play
the
villain
,
dougray
scott
,
doe
so
in
a
one-dimension
gruff
tone
,
which
did
not
distinguish
him
in
that
role
.

At
least
,
if
the
film
got
the
villain
part
right
,
it
might
have
had
some
fun
with
thi
nonsens
.

soon
the
diabol
scientist
is
on
a
plane
talk
to
someon
he
trust
call
dimitri
,
but
then
the
plane
is
taken
over
by
terrorist
who
set
it
on
automat
pilot
and
crash
it
into
the
rocki
mountain
.

befor
they
crash
the
plane
and
parachut
out
of
it
,
the
one
who
wa
pose
as
dimitri
,
turn
out
to
be
sean
ambros
-lrb-
scott
-rrb-
,
a
rogu
member
of
the
imf
,
which
is
a
cia-lik
clone
.

He
steal
the
packag
with
the
antidot
,
peel
off
a
latex
mask
,
which
is
a
replica
of
the
hero
of
the
stori
,
ethan
hunt
-lrb-
cruis
-rrb-
,
who
had
pose
as
dimitri
to
the
scientist
befor
and
had
therebi
gain
hi
trust
.

sean
and
hi
group
of
terrorist
carri
out
thi
attack
becaus
they
plan
a
viru
plagu
on
the
world
and
then
to
sell
the
victim
the
antidot
at
mark
up
price
.

We
alreadi
saw
the
gimmick
of
peel
mask
use
in
face/off
and
in
the
origin
mission
imposs
,
which
as
convolut
a
plot
as
that
film
had
,
it
wa
still
a
superior
film
to
thi
sequel
.

woo
ha
run
thi
peel
mask
routin
into
the
ground
,
as
it
is
use
so
often
in
thi
film
by
both
side
,
so
much
so
,
that
it
blur
ani
ethic
charact
differ
between
good
guy
or
villain
.

It
make
it
seem
as
if
anyon
could
be
anoth
charact
,
which
distort
the
realiti
of
the
film
and
make
it
imposs
for
the
film
to
make
much
sens
.

next
we
are
in
a
mountain
rang
in
the
american
southwest
,
and
ethan
is
on
vacat
,
hang
by
hi
fingertip
while

he

,
with

run
a

but
he
also
must
get
a
jewel

He

In

who
inject

as
the

ethan
rescu

If

but
with

In

thi

and
will
in

probabl
do
well
in
