,
and
tell
her
she
'd
better
be
make
these
demand
,
too
.

talk
about
coitu
interruptu
.

booti
call
is
a
film
that
doe
not
know
whether
it
want
to
be
a
regular
comedi
or
one
of
those
over-the-top
comedi
.

the
differ
between
the
two
is
that
in
the
latter
,
thing
constantli
happen
which
are
so
far
remov
from
realiti
.

In
thi
categori
,
for
exampl
,
you
have
ace
ventura
:
privat
eye
on
the
mild
side
,
and
airplan
!

at
the
extrem
.

there
are
time
dure
booti
call
where
the
film
step
out
of
it
shell
and
tri
for
thi
statu
,
but
then
too
often
quickli
retreat
to
the
safeti
of
convent
.

It
is
disappoint
,
and
even
wors
,
distract
.

there
are
also
instanc
where
the
screenplay
by
takashi
bufford
and
bootsi
parker
-lrb-
are
those
real
name
?
-rrb-

doe
not
live
up
to
it
potenti
,
as
joke
are
left
unexploit
or
even
ruin
by
bad
write
.

for
instanc
,
there
is
a
scene
where
our
main
charact
are
in
a
chines
restaur
.

bunz
goe
up
to
an
asian
gangster
and
speak
to
him
in
fluent
cantones
,
much
to
everyon
's
surpris
.

howev
,
when
ask
how
he
learn
the
languag
,
he
goe
into
thi
explan
of
how
he
start
pick
up
word
from
late-night
kung-fu
film
,
and
soon
gain
masteri
.

thi
negat
the
ludicr
of
the
entir
scene
.

If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
when
ask
how
he
learn
to
speak
chines
,
bunz
simpli
repli
with
,
``
kung-fu
movi
,
''
and
then
move
on
,
the
joke
would
have
been
much
more
effect
.

thi
is
becaus
it
would
have
been
total
unbeliev
,
but
funni
becaus
we
know
it
is
unbeliev
.

By
explain
the
point
and
tri
to
make
the
ridicul
plausibl
,
the
film
is
not
give
it
viewer
enough
credit
.

the
inconsist
and
uncertain
believ
unfortun
also
rais
other
question
.

whi
are
two
such
dispar
peopl
like
bunz
and
rushon
best
friend
?

whi
do
rushon
and
nikki
fix
up
bunz
and
lysterin
?

If
nikki
is
so
obsess
with
safe
sex
,
whi
doe
n't
she
have
some
condom
at
her
own
apart
?

these
question
are
not
answer
by
the
screenplay
,
but
are
overlook
for
the
sole
reason
of
move
the
plot
forward
.

A
veri
notic
qualiti
of
booti
call
is
the
preval
of
unnecessari
foul
languag
.

some
movi
use
a
lot
of
swear
word
,
but
use
them
under
veri
justifi
circumst
,
as
when
they
are
employ
consist
with
a
charact
's
pattern
of
speech
.

other
film
,
such
as
the
recent
jacki
brown
,
use
them
in
way
that
almost
parodi
themselv
.

booti
call
just
stick
them
in
to
get
laugh
,
and
it
doe
n't
work
.

they
stick
out
like
sore
thumb
becaus
there
is
almost
no
reason
to
use
them
.

half
of
the
scene
seem
to
occur
for
no
reason
.

the
chines
restaur
,
a
holdup
at
a
conveni
store
,
and
a
trip
to
the
hospit
seem
to
have
noth
to
do
with
the
stori
,
and
are
in
there
for
filler
.

thi
is
surpris
,
consid
that
the
film
is
less
than
eighti
minut
long
.

It
's
too
bad
that
the
core
of
the
film
is
n't
much
better
,
sinc
it
is
compris
of
sometim
funni
,
but
forgett
dialog
.

I
refer
you
to
the
first
paragraph
of
thi
review
.
