for
a
swarm
of
12-and
13-year-old

,
it
appear

have
been
made

In
a
classic
exampl
of
tell

,
``

''
open
with
a
truckload
of
mumbo

about
forc
of

,
forc
of
light
and
how
``

So
much
for

clown
manipul
simmon
,
now
in
superhuman
spawn
form
,
into
a
stand
off
with
wynn
.

wynn
,
who
think
he
is
in
leagu
with
the
double-d
clown
,
recogn
spawn
as
a
threat
and
undergo
an
oper
where

''

phew
.

got
all
that
?

It
would
be
easi
to
dismiss
``
spawn
''
as
just
anoth
one
of
those
heavy-on-fx
,
short-on-subst
action
pic
,
but
it
doe
n't
even
work
on
that
level
.

the
computer-gener
sequenc
are
often
and
plenti
,
and
the
problem
is
that
they
look
too
computer-gener
.

the
sever
scene
set
in
hell
present
a
devil
that
look
and
act
like
a
video
game
graphic
--
with
the
movi
's
healthi
budget
you
'd
think
they
could
have
afford
to
make
hi
mouth
move
when
he
talk
.

other
element
of
the
movi
are
so-so
;
spawn
's
enorm
red
,
flow
cape
is
a
wonder
sight
,
but
it
's
too
obviou
when
he
's
be
play
by
a
costum
actor
or
an
imag
.

In
movi
like
``
contact
,
''
the
special
effect
serv
the
stori
.

In
``
spawn
,
''
they
are
the
stori
.

and
spawn
himself
is
n't
even
an
interest
charact
.

the
film
's
relianc
on
razzle-dazzl
would
be
accept
if
we
were
given
somebodi
to
root
for
,
but
both
simmon
and
hi
funki
alter-ego
are
complet
underdevelop
.

what
we
need
is
a
batman
,
a
luke
skywalk
.

even
watch
the
adventur
of
kleenex
man
would
be
more
interest
than
spawn
.

poor
leguizamo
.

He
star
in
februari
's
``
the
pest
,
''
a
movi
that
I
still
think
is
the
year
's
worst
so
far
,
although
thi
one
doe
give
it
a
run
for
it
money
.

As
clown
,
he
overact
to
the
extrem
,
never
miss
an
opportun
for
a
poor-tast
punchlin
.

leguizamo
fart
green
mist
,
munch
a
pizza
slice
cover
with
maggot
and
even
don
a
mini-skirt
and
perform
a
cheerlead
routin
,
all
befor
turn
into
a
giant
grey
demon
.

the
guy
wa
brilliant
in
``
To
wong
foo
,
thank
for
everyth
!
''

juli
newmar

''
''

what
is
he
do
wast
hi
talent
in
thi
and
``
the
pest
''
?

I
'm
one
of
the
few
peopl
that
like
``
batman
&
robin
,
''
thi
summer
's
other
big-budget
comic
book
film
.

yet
after
catch
thi
movi
and
make
the
inevit
comparison
,
I
can
onli
hope
peopl
will
chang
their
mind
and
think
of
``
batman
''
as
the
superior
adapt
.

there
's
a
compel
stori
somewher
in
``
spawn
''
--
includ
strong
religi
overton
and
the
debut
of
the
first
african-american
superhero
ever
--
but
it
's
just
not
found
anywher
near
here
.

As
it
is
,
``
spawn
''
is
just
aw
--
it
stink
wors
than
a
dead
trout
.
