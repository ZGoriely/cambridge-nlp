lengthi
and
lousi
are
two
word
to
describ
the
bore
drama
the
english
patient
.

great
act
,
music
and
cinematographi
were
nice
,
but
too
mani
dull
sub-plot
and
charact
made
the
film
hard
to
follow
.

even

Do
n't
get
the
wrong
idea
,
it
may
sound
good
and
the
trailer
may
be
tempt
,
but
good
is
the
last
thing
thi
film
is
.

too
much
to

.

the
onli
redeem
qualiti
about
thi
film
are
the
fine
act
of
fienn
and
dafo
and
the
beauti
desert
cinematographi
.

other
than
these
,
the
english
patient
is
full
of
worthless
scene
of
boredom
and
wast
entir
too
much
film
.
