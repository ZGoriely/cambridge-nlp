To

and
to
watch
thi
film
is
almost
as

He

He

who
ha
seen
hi
share
of
hard
time
.

He
speak
in
a
hush

menac
tone
of
voic
.

In
other
word
,
thi
is
sylvest

act
like
...
sylvest

and
like
most
of
hi
previou
role
,
hi
charact
is
a
shallow
,
one-dimension
thug
whose
modu
operandi
is
to
talk

,
find

with
the

be
tough
is
all
that
jack

know
.

yet
,
even
tough

know
when
to
put
famili
first
.

As
the
stori

He
take
a
break
from

As
he

they
includ
a

a

ani
one
of

all
of

have
the

but
do
n't
expect
an
exercis
in
sleuth
where
well-plac
clue
lead
carter
to
the
truth
.

He
's
all
brawn
and
no

so
there

By
the
time

we
're

it

thi
is

needless

and
the

It

As
a
result

``
