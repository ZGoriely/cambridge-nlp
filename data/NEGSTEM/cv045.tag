I
ask

from

who

the

had
made
up

;
I
'll
catch
it
on

cabl
in

but
,
soon

follow

we
could
n't

about
a
``

''
boy

and
a
``
popular

,
the
two
bump
into
each
other
so
mani
time
that
eventu
they
becom
best
friend
.

but
in
the
movi
,
a
male
and
a
femal
can
not
be
friend
without
have
that
nag
feel
of
attract
for
each

detmer
,
jason

-rrb-
,
ryan
and
jennif
attempt
to
discov
the
true
mean
of
their
relationship
.

the
film
definit
live
up
to
the
dread
three
adjectives-and
mindless
entertain
is
nowher
to
be
found
.

I
could
hardli
sit
through
theminut
run
time
for
sever
reason
.

the
dialogu
is
probabl
the
worst
I
have
ever
seen
in
ani
movi
,
mainli
becaus
the
whole
movi
depend
on
the
bore
script
and
the
ridicul
word
these
charact
use
is
what
hollywood
think
kid
can
relat
to
.

It
is
almost
offens
.

An
exampl
of
an
insight
convers
:
-lrb-
well
it
's
not
as
bad
as
wing
command
I
guess
-rrb-
the
support
cast
is
also
pain
useless
.

detmer
and
bigg
stand
in
the
way
for
anyth
interest
to
happen
with
their
own
bore
,
pointless
subplot
.

and
although
thi
is
suppos
to
be
from
both
perspect
of
the
human
sex
,
prinz
Jr
's
ryan
domin
the
screen
while
forlani
's
jennif
simpli
act
as
a
dilemma
for
him
to
work
with
.

We
never
learn
anyth
about
jennif
which
is
a
shame
too
becaus
forlani
is
the
onli
actor
to
bring
ani
life
into
her
charact
.

teenag
or
not
:
you
'll
hate
thi
movi
,
I
guarante
it
.

mayb
I
should
rent
she
's
all
that
again
.

Is
it
realli
as
good
as
I
think
it
is
?
