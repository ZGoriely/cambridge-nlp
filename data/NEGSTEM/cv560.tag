-rrb-
or
raider

the
lost
ark
-lrb-
1981
-rrb-
,
a
tear
come
to
my
eye
due
to
the
awesom
talent
,
skill
and
entertain
that
is
on
display
.

even
lower
grade
film
such
as
the
nake
gun
33Â 1/3
-lrb-
1994
-rrb-
or
ghostbust

-lrb-
1988
-rrb-
while

certainli
not
a
wast
of

valu
.

then
there
's
My
favourit
martian
,
the
exact
opposit
of
what
a
movi
should
be
:
a
hurri
,
poorli
written
and
act
movi
with
one
goal
,
to
make
money
.

My

than

christoph

hi
way
through
the
entir
movi
,
I
've
never
seen
a
man
pull
a
face
for
93
minut
until
now
.

jeff
daniel
play
'
stapl
nice
guy
'
and
hi
role
is
useless
.

hi
perform
is
incred
lazi
,
although
hi
paperthin
charact
doe
n't
deserv
more
than
the
perform
he
give
.

darryl
hannah
look
as
pretti
as
ever
,
but
her
role
is
somewhat
,
erm
,
limit
.

hurley
mistak
'
act
'
for
'
shout
and
look
like
a
twit
'
and
win
the
david

for

most

way
to
go
liz
!

for
the
support
cast
,
disney
manag
to
assembl
everi
charact
actor
out
there
,
dure
the
film
I
wa
go
'
he
wa
the
guy
in
...
ah
.
.

er
...
'
befor
final
give
up
and
switch
off
.

anoth
major
setback
is
the
stapl
'
comedi
sidekick
.
'

unfortun
,
the
writer
-lrb-
sherri
stoner
and
deanna
oliv
,
if
anyon
care
-rrb-
forget
that
a
comedi
sidekick
need
to
be
'
funni
.
'

instead
,
they
deliv
zoot
,
the
martian
deepli
unfunni
sidekick
.

although
meant
to
be
a
manic
charact
no
doubt
,
everi
line
that
come
out
of
hi
'
neck
'
is
a
dud
.

A
real
dud
.

citizen
kane
deliv
more
laugh
a
minut
than
hi
hell
spawn
piec
of
polyest
.

even
the
kid
in
the
audienc
were
insult
by
thi
charact
:
not
one
child
even
bother
to
smirk
.

It
's
a
nice
special
effect
,
though
.

anoth
problem
with
thi
comedi
are
the
gag
themselv
.

Or
rather
,
the
lack
of
them
.

My
favourit
martian
reach
a
new
level
of
toilet
humour
:
it
goe
past
the
bowl
,
down
the
pipe
and
into
the
sewer
.

now
,
toilet
humour
can
be
funni
,
as
dumb
and
dumber
-lrb-
1994
-rrb-
humor
show
.

but
here
,
charact
fart
,
belch
and
almost
get
crap
on
-lrb-
liter
-rrb-
is
not
'
amus
.
'

It
's
insult
.

there
's
one
good
gag
right
befor
the
credit
,
but
it
appear
the
guy
who
wrote
that
gag
tragic
die
and
hi
unfunni
twin
continu
.

either
that
,
or
they
were
hope
that
easi
to
pleas
six
year
old
would
n't
mind
the
fact
that
hi
movi
is
beaten
by
men
At
work
in
the
funni
stake
.

ye
,
men
At
work
.

yowza
!

the
fact
that
a
lot
of
money
wa
pump
into
thi
film
,
and
that
they
actual
got
peopl
to
agre
to
be
in
thi
film
just
depress
me
even
more
.

there
are
thousand
of
brilliant
film
out
there
that
ca
n't
get
distribut
,
yet
trash
like
thi
get
releas
nation-wid
with
eas
.

thank
,
as
soon
as
it
make
it
's
money
,
it
will
never
be
seen
again
,
and
My
favourit
martian
will
end
up
where
the
two
lead
charact
do
near
the
end
of
the
movi
:
down
the
toilet
.
