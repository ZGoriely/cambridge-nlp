ye
,
she
goe
for
the
major
,
but
,
miracl
of
miracl
,
the
other
three
come
out
aliv
anyway
.

not
content
with
a
tradit
firefight
stori
,
chri
soth
's
screenplay
attempt
to
jazz
it
up
by
have
william
forsyth
from
palookavil
play
a
viciou
killer
name
randi
earl
shay
who
set
a
forest
fire
so
that
he
can
join
the
crew
to
put
it
out
and
then
escap
.

-lrb-
``
hood
in
the
wood
,
''
is
what
the
``
ground-pound
''
yell
out
when
the
convict
are
buse
in
to
help
them
fight
the
fire
.
-rrb-

along
the
way
,
shay
pick
up
an
ornithologist
hostag
play
by
suzi
ami
,
who
turn
out
to
have
been
train
in
warrior
way
by
her
father
,
who
wa
a
marin
drill
instructor
.

most
of
the
highli
predict
movi
is
a
long
chase
in
which
poor
howi
long
is
given
one
ridicul
stunt
after
anoth
to
look
silli
perform
.

He
fling
a
chain
saw
backward
over
hi
head
while
ride
a
speed
motorcycl
so
that
the
saw
can
hit
the
windshield
of
the
pursu
truck
.

arguabl
the
low
point
is
when
he
escap
from
a
lock
burn
build
by
ride
a
motorcycl
conveni
park
insid
.

use
a
ramp
,
he
shoot
straight
out
of
the
top
of
the
build
's
attic
,
and
when
he
hit
the
ground
,
he
just
ride
off
in
a
cloud
of
dust
.

when
the
film
is
n't
use
some
stock
footag
of
actual
forest
fire
,
the
simul
one
look
hokey
.

editor
jack
hofstra
cheapen
the
action
even
more
by
hi
use
of
burn
flame
in
scene
transit
.

the
end
,
with
it
sick
twist
,
manag
to
be
even
wors
than
the
rest
of
the
movi
.

perhap
the
best
that
can
be
said
for
the
pictur
is
the
faint
prais
I
heard
afterward
in
the
lobbi
,
``
It
's
not
as
bad
as
some
of
the
televis
sitcom
.
''

firestorm
run
merci
just
1:29
.

It
is
rate
R
for
violenc
and
languag
and
would
be
accept
for
teenag
