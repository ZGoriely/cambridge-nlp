some
peopl
,
howev
,
keep
their
cloth
on
.

you
do
not
watch
porn
film
for
their
intellectu
valu
,
nor
do
you
write
review
on
them
.

that
's
whi
thi
review
will
be
short
.

It
seem
that
thi
film
will
end
up
in
the
porn
section
when
it
hit
the
video
store
.

there
is
no
stori
,
script
,
point
or
act
.

onli
nake
bodi
,
which
is
exactli
the
point
.

here
is
the
so
call
plot
:
nomi
,
the
23-year-old
with
a
dark
past
as
a
hooker
,
ha
hitchhik
from
somewher
back
east
to
perform
in
a
show
where
a
dancer
doe
n't
wear
much
more
than
a
light
coat
of
powder
and
a
big
,
fake
smile
.

No
one
is
twist
nomi
's
arm
.

No
one
is
hold
her
grandmoth
hostag
.

she
want
to
do
thi
.

and
that
is
what
she
is
do
till
the
end
credit
.

So
what
's
the
problem
then
?

what
's
the
point
?

what
's
the
film
about
?

Is
there
anyon
whose
aspir
could
inspir
less
sympathi
?

thi
film
can
be
describ
in
one
sentenc
:
obscen
level
of
incompet
,
excess
stupid
in
the
stori
line
,
gross
neglig
of
the
viewer
's
intellig
,
a
prurient
interest
in
the
quick
buck
.

believ
me
,
after
an
hour
with
these
charact
,
act
and
script
,
you
'll
start
hope
for
someon
to
kill
somebodi
.

elizabeth

make
a
laughabl
tri
as
the
heroin
of
thi
film
,
that
is
bad
even
for
eszterha

script
.

her
charact
is
the
onli
one
that
is
at
least
half
written
and
she
could
realli
have
done
better
.

her
charact
deni
the
fact
that
she
is
a
whore
for
the
industri
,
sell
her
bodi
to
the
hungri
eye
of
the
horni
public

``
I
am
not

,
she
scream
,
but
doe
it
in
such
an
over

that

In
fact
the

bring
terribl
to

new

unknown
level

not

It

there
is
not

of

you
might
call

the
