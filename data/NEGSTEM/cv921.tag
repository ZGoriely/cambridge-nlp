At

and
with

thi
is
a
joyless
exercis
of
a

a

At

and
admittedli
the
aveng
is
,
more
than
most
,
heavili
depend
upon
style
--
but
they
're
no
fun
to
watch
,
and
I
found
myself
grow
increasingli
distant
and
annoy
by
the
lack
of
spark
between
the
two
cheekili
iron
charact
as
they
navig
through
the
pictur
's
caper-esqu
plot
.

when
not
check
my
wristwatch
or
shift
restlessli
in
my
seat
,
I
began
to
allevi
the
boredom
by
consid
how
thi
all
might
have
play
out
had
the
filmmak
chose
to
go
instead
with
that
erstwhil
emma
as
our
mrs.
peel
--
no
,
not
kate
beckinsal
-lrb-
although
the
notion
now
intrigu
me
-rrb-
,
but
gwyneth
paltrow
,
who
wa
origin
in
the
run
for
the
part
and
can
verit
handl
a
spot-on
english
accent
.

If
noth
els
,
it
'd
at
least
be
highli
entertain
for
the
incongru
sight
of
the
vagu
twiggish
young
actress
kick
butt
.

the
stori
,
such
as
it
is
,
involv
the
ever-bemus
tandem
of
steed
and
peel
combat
the
malevol
sir
august
de
wynter

sean

-rrb-
,
an
eccentr
aristocrat

the
safeti
of
the
nation
with

-lrb-
they
also
sip
a
lot
of
tea
.
-rrb-

overlook
some
goofi
clone
nonsens
and
quirki
hijinx
involv
our
protagonist
'
superior
,
it
sound
far
better
than
it
play
,
and
is
render
almost
indecipher
by
blatant
post-product
tinker
;
it
's
clearli
evid
that
the
pictur
ha
been
cut
to
shred
.

the
aveng
wa
never
about
grip
drama
,
and
our
hero
accordingli
never
take
villain
sir
august
veri
serious
,
but
given
the
lack
of
cohes
in
the
plot
and
the
lack
of
menac
convey
by
the
buffoonish
maniac
,
it
's
all
decidedli
uncompel
.

mr.
conneri
,
who
's
onscreen
bare
long
enough
to
regist
an
impress
,
approach
the
role
like
a
man
fulfil
a
contractu
oblig
,
simultan
chew
the
sceneri
while
unabl
to
hide
hi
disinterest
.

At
least
it
all
look
good
.

thi
is
a
genuin
handsom
product
,
with
fine
costum
design
by
anthoni
powel
and
crispli
shot
by
roger
pratt
.

In
particular
,
the
gleam
product
design
by
stuart
craig
command
attent
,
adeptli
draw
element
both
old
and
new
in
order
to
depict
thi
great
britain
.

there
are
a
hand
of
strike
visual
moment
in
the
film
,
includ
an
attack
by
a
swarm
of
giant
robot
bee
and
a
nice
shot
of
steed
and
peel
find
a
way
to
walk
on
water
,
but
the
film
is
so
unremittingli
dull
that
even
these
instanc
fail
to
stir
interest
or
rais
puls
rate
.

By
the
time
the
film
's
climax
had
arriv
,
my
interest
wa
not
with
the
sight
of
steed
and
sir
august
slug
it
out
amidst
crash
wave
and
thunder
rain
,
but
with
the
quickest
escap
rout
from
the
theatr
.

not
coincident
,
the
entic
bit
of
visual
bravura
were
the
shot
assembl
into
the
movi
's
remark
trailer
,
a
savvi
piec
of
work
which
iron
is
infinit
more
appeal
that
the
featur
film
itself
;
the
first
promo
which
made
the
round
in
earli
spring
is
probabl
my
favourit
studio
trailer
so
far
thi
year
.

It
's
everyth
that
the
aveng
is
not
--
sauci
,
clever
,
engag
,
and
entertain
.

A
crush
disappoint
,
the
film
is
one
of
the
worst
outing
of
the
year
--
too
drearili
aw
to
be
savour
as
gleefulli
bad
,
too
polish
to
overlook
it
defici
.

there
may
be
upcom
pictur
that
are
even
more
lifeless
than
the
aveng
,
but
I
sure
hope
not
.
