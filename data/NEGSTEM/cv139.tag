If
snake
eye
were
a
dog
,
you
'd
put
it
to
sleep
.

If
it
wa
a
couch
,
you
'd
put
it
out
on
the
sidewalk
,
where
it
would
sit
for
a
week
.

If
it
were
your
child
,
you
'd
be
read
militari
school
catalog
.

If
it
were
a
ship
--
no
,
it
would
n't
be
the
titan
,
that
would
impli
glamor
and
tragedi
--
it
would
be
the
exxon
valdez
.

-lrb-
person
side
note
:
I
saw
thi
movi
on
the
road
dure
a
houston
busi
trip
.

for
whatev
reason
,
my
hotel
's
cabl
system
wa
n't
show
the
astros-brav
game
,
which
featur
a
randi
johnson-greg
maddux
matchup
.

thi
forc
me
to
pay
full
price
for
snake
eye
instead
of
watch
a
perfectli
good
basebal
game
for
free
--
so
the
invect
,
deserv
as
it
is
,
should
be
seen
in
that
perspect
.
-rrb-

snake
eye
is
suppos
to
be
a
mysteri
movi
,
and
good
mysteri
movi
are
suppos
to
leav
you
ask
yourself
question
on
the
way
out
of
theater
.

snake
eye
is
not
a
good
mysteri
movi
,
but
I
had
some
question
:
where
's
the
manag
,
and
how
do
I
get
a
re-admit
pass
?

If
I
fall
asleep
on
the
drive
home
and
wreck
my
rent-a-car
,
can
I
sue
brian
De
palma
?

Is
it
too
late
for
the
academi
to
revok
nicola
cage
's
oscar
?

will
someon
pleas
-lrb-
I
'm
beg
you
-rrb-
give
gari
sinis
a
role
worthi
of
hi
talent
?

and
how
,
exactli
doe
cage
end
up
wear
the
exact
same
shirt
and
tie
as
sinis
doe
?

the
first
and
most
glaringli
wrong
thing
with
snake
eye
is
the
trailer
.

If
you
've
seen
the
trailer
without
see
the
movi
,
consid
yourself
fortun
.

the
trailer
is
a
work
of
sheer
geniu
.

It
manag
to
convey
everyth
worthi
of
the
movi
--
the
noteworthi
steadicam
work
,
the
exuber
of
cage
's
perform
as
a
thoroughli
corrupt
atlant
citi
policeman
,
the
essenti
element
of
the
margin
plot
.

the
expert
craftsman
who
piec
togeth
a
fairli
good
trailer
out
of
snippet
of
a
wretch
movi
deserv
prais
and
a
percentag
of
the
gross
.

-lrb-
Is
a
best
trailer
categori
at
the
oscar
that
far-fetch
,
after
all
?
-rrb-

but
all
it
doe
is
set
us
up
for
an
overwhelmingli
disappoint
movi
.

the
trailer
set
up
what
should
have
been
a
promis
plot
:
detect
ricki
santoro
-lrb-
cage
-rrb-
must
solv
the
mysteri
of
who
shot
the
secretari
of
defens
at
an
atlant
citi
pay-per-view
box
match
.

unfortun
,
there
are
multipl
problem
afoot
.

the
trailer
give
away
much
,
too
much
of
the
stori
.

the
shooter
is
kill
instantli
,
so
the
stori
revolv
around
whi
the
secretari
wa
kill
and
who
is
involv
in
the
conspiraci
.

the
film
's
secret
is
ho-hum
at
best
,
and
anyon
who
ha
watch
the
trailer
and
is
awar
of
the
law
of
economi
of
charact
can
figur
out
who
the
top
conspir
is
.

without
an
interest
plot
,
without
interest
dialogu
,
and
without
much
of
a
reason
to
care
about
the
charact
or
the
stori
,
snake
eye
is
a
failur
on
almost
everi
possibl
level
.

As
much
as
I
hate
thi
movi
,
I
must
give
brian
De
palma
one
tini
bit
of
credit
.

De

inconsist

there

is

there

it
