that
combin
both
the
best

In

the
current
crop

ha
been
maddeningli
convolut

visual
sumptuou

``
romeo
must
die
''
is
in
mani
way
a
fun
film
.

It
is
both
absurd
and
assur
.

the
basic
plot
of
a
gangster
want
to
becom
legitim
echo
``
the
godfath
''
.

the
relationship
between
jet
Li
's
han
and
aaliyah
's
trish
o'day
remind
us
of
abel
ferrera
's
``
china
girl
''
,
except
that
romeo
must
die
's
coupl
never
onc
exchang
more
than
a
love
glanc
toward
one
anoth
.

their
romanc
is
much
more
puritan
than
ani
other
romanc
in
film
histori
.

the
perform
are
adequ
if
not
fulli
accept
.

Li
,
of
cours
ha
the
showiest
part
,
have
to
express
both
an
innoc
and
steadfast
determin
.

allayah

in
her
featur
film
debut
manag
to
carri
what
littl
is
ask
of
her
with
a
certain
style
and
grace
.

It
's
obviou
that
the
camera
love
her
and
she
is
veri
photogen
.

but
,
still
the
part
is
under
written
in
such
a
way
that
even
a
poor
perform
would
not
have
affect
it
.

delro
lindo
as
issac
o'day
carri
himself
well
in
the
film
.

An
unsung
and
under
appreci
actor
,
mr.
lindo
turn
out
the
film
best
perform
.

the
other
perform
are
all
adequ
in
what
the
script
ask
of
them
except
for
D.
B.
woodsid
as
issac
's
son
,
colin
.

the
perform
is
undirect
,
with
the
charact
chang
hi
tone
and
demeanor
in
accord
with
whatev
locat
he
is
in
.

An
unfocus
perform
that
should
have
been
reign
in
and
/
or
better
written
.

first
time
director
andrzej
bartkowiak
doe
a
workmanlik
job
in
handl
the
film
.

have
a
career
as
one
of
the
industri
's
best
cinematograph
,
bartkiwiak
know
how
to
set
up
hi
shot
,
and
``
romeo
must
die
''
doe
look
good
.

but
the
pace
of
the
film
is
letharg
,
onli
come
to
a
semblanc
of
life
dure
the
fight
scene
.

the
script
by
eric
bernt
and
john
jarrel
is
not
focus
in
such
a
way
that
we
can
care
about
the
charact
or
the
situat
they
are
in
.

the
big
gambit
of
buy
up
waterfront
properti
to
facilit
the
build
of
a
sport
center
for
a
nfl
team
is
needlessli
confus
.

and
of
cours
the
common
practic
of
one
charact
be
the
comic
relief
of
the
film
becom
pain
obviou
here
as
anthoni
anderson
as
allayah
's
bodyguard
,
mauric
ha
no
comic
time
whatsoev
.

the
best
thing
about
the
film
are
it
fight
scene
.

jet
Li
is
a
master
of
these
intric
physic
battl
.

one
need
onli
to
see
hi
film
``
fist
of
legend
''
to
understand
that
the
man
is
without
peer
in
the
realm
of
martial
art
combat
.

here
,
jet
is
given
the
opportun
to
show
off
in
a
way
that
``
lethal
weapon
4
''
-lrb-
jet
's
u.s.
debut
-rrb-
did
n't
allow
.

unfortun
,
a
lot
of
jet
's
fight
are
aid
with
comput
effect
that
detract
from
hi
abil
and
precis
.

also
``
romeo
must
die
''
must
be
note
as
have
the
most
singularli
useless
effect
ever
commit
to
film
,
and
that
is
an
x-ray
effect
that
appear
three
time
dure
the
cours
of
the
film
,
show
the
effect
of
bone
crush
blow
on
an
oppon
.

obvious
a
homag
to
the
fame
x-ray
scene
from
sonni
chiba
's
``
streetfight
''
,
the
scene
here
are
just
pointless
and
interfer
with
the
pace
of
the
film
.

It
's
as
if
the
film
ha
stop
and
a
video
game
ha
been
insert
.

one
problem
though
about
the
fight
scene
.

those
that
are
familiar
with
hong
kong
action
know
that
even
though
the
film
are
fantasi
and
are
as
remov
from
realiti
as
ani
anim
or
cartoon
.

they
do
have
an
intern
rhythm
to
them
.

A
heartbeat
,
so
to
speak
in
their
choreographi
.

the
fight
scene
in
a
hong
kong
film
breath
with
an
emot
reson
.

thi
is
creat
by
the
perform
,
the
direct
and
the
edit
.

here
in
``
romeo
must
die
''
,
there
is
no
staccato
.

everi
fight
scene
,
even
though
technic
adroit
and
amaz
becom
bore
as
the
edit
both
cut
away
from
battl
at
hand
and
simpl
follow
a
set
pattern
.

the
rhythm
is
monoton
.

A
hong
kong
film
ha
a
tempo
that
chang
,
heighten
it
emot
impact
.

`
rmd
'
is
limit
to
a
standard
tempo
,
not
allow
for
ani
emot
content
whatsoev
.

A
fine
exampl
of
thi
differ
can
be
found
by
examin
a
coupl
of
jacki
chan
's
film
.
.

watch
the
restaur
fight
from
the
film
``
rush
hour
''
and
notic
that
the
context
of
the
fight
,
while
technic
amaz
is
rather
flat
-lrb-
the
frame
and
cut
alway
do
not
help
-rrb-
.

now
look
at
the
warehous
fight
from
``
rumbl
in
the
bronx
''
.

there
you
have
a
heartbeat
,
and
emot
draw
that
doe
n't
let
the
audienc
catch
it
breath
.

the
stop
and
paus
for
dramat
effect
work
perfectli
,
caus
the
viewer
to
be
both
astound
and
flabbergast
.

here
in
`
romeo
must
die
'
,
the
fight
scene
have
no
more
emot
content
or
charact
than
ani
john
wayn
barroom
brawl
.

jet
Li
is
a
grand
and
person
screen
presenc
.

it
's
a
shame
that
hi
full
talent
were
not
use
to
full
effect
here
.

one
day
filmmak
here
in
the
u.s.
will
stop
make
film
by
the
number
and
start
to
embrac
the
style
and
emot
that
ha
made
hong
kong
action
pictur
such
a
commod
.

until
then
,
we
'll
be
left
with
emot
hollow
product
like
``
the
replac
killer
''
and
,
current
``
romeo
