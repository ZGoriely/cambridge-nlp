In

I
place
the
blame

in

on

recent
hollywood

by

,
for

A
lot
of
it
is

,
do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
but
,
becaus

could

feel
sympathet
toward
hi

as
the
spawn

.

spawn
attempt
to
show
all
of
thi
but
doe
not
spend
nearli
the
time
it
should
to
do
so
.

when
the
charact
are
develop
,
they
seem
absurd
rather
than
touch
.

the
cartoonish
dialogu
and
implaus
subplot
-lrb-
a

the
antidot
to
a
superviru

spawn
,
in
an
appar
attempt
to
duplic
the
success
of
batman
,
also
unwis
spend
too
much
time
on
a
villain
,
the
violat
-lrb-

favor
the
joker
over

john
leguizamo
,
like
jack
nicholson
in

in
the
cast
as
the
violat
;
michael
jai
white
-lrb-
Al
simmon
/
spawn
-rrb-
is
second
.

I
ordinarili
find
leguizamo
an
intens
annoy
presenc
in
film
which
seem
to
make
him
a
perfect
candid
for
the
violat
.

the
film
,
howev
,
spend
so
much
time
on
the
violat
's
offens
antic
that
they
grate
on
the
nerv
.

appar
meant
to
be
the
comic
relief
in
the
film
-lrb-
as
nicholson
wa
in
batman
-rrb-
,
especi
when
contrast
with
the
sullen
spawn
,
the
violat
's
line
are
oftentim
grotesqu
and
unfunni
,
leav
the
audienc
wish
he
would
leav
.

leguizamo
doe
a
satisfactori
job
in
the
role
,
but
he
is
seen
far
too
often
in
the
film
.

michael
jai
white
,
a
rel
newcom
to
theatric
releas
,
seem
to
be
an
appeal
actor
,
and
he
handl
hi
role
adequ
,
but
we
see
littl
of
him
without
variou
mask
on
.

more
time
need
to
be
spent
on
white
's
charact
befor
he
becam
spawn
for
the
movi
to
pull
at
the

.

A
special
note
should
be
made
about
martin
sheen
as
the
over-the-top
,
obnoxi
,
evil
gener
wynn
.

easili
the
hammiest
perform
in

it
's
hard
to
imagin
how

muck
up
hi
role
so
much
;
after
all
,
he
play
a
vietnam
assasin
brilliantli
in
