appreci
how
utterli
lousi
``
speci
II
''
is
.

with
few
except
,
sequel
tend
to
be
wors
than
the
film
that
spawn
them
,
but
the
fact
that
``
speci
II
''
is
a
follow-up
is
n't
the
onli
reason
it
's
so
miser
.

It
's
the
predict
storylin
,
the
cardboard
charact
,
the
banal
dialogu
,
the
fail
attempt
at
humor
,
the
revolt
special
effect
,
the
gratuit
nuditi
-lrb-
all
femal
,
of
cours
-rrb-
,
the
bad
act
,
and
the
bland
direct
.

the

so
that
it
can

and
inadvert
bring
some
alien
slime
in
a

the
slime
,
well
,
sort
of
jump
out
at
them
and
the
screen
turn
black
.

that
should
have
been
the
end
of
the
movi
right
there
.

back
on
terra
firma
,
at
least
one
of
the
crew
is
now
a
carrier
of
alien
dna
and
,
as
you
'll
rememb
if
you
saw
the
first
movi
,
driven
by
a
strong
urg
to
procreat
.

On

one
of
her
kinfolk
``

''
which
we
are
forc
to
wit
in
gross-out
detail
,
but
otherwis
there
doe
n't
appear
to
be
a
whole
lot
of
reason
whi
henstridg
is
in
thi
film
,
unless
it
wa
written
into
her
contract
-lrb-
let
's
hope
it
cite
one
sequel
and
one

-rrb-
.

eve
final
break
free
of

but
the
effect
are
so
messi
you
ca
n't
realli
see
what
's
go
on
.

peter
boyl
is
total
wast
as
an

scientist
who
scream
``
I
told
'em
not
to
go

''

at
the
top
of
hi
lung
,
refer
to
the
mar
mission
but
more
like
aim
at
the
maker
of
thi
piffl
.

michael
madsen
repris
hi
role
of
press
lennox
-lrb-
so
that
he
can
enter
high
secur

,
flash
a

and
claim
to
be
press
,
mayb
?
-rrb-

,
as
doe
marg
helgenberg
as
dr.
laura
baker
,
the
one
subject
eve
to
the
tv
rerun
.

they
're
both
unbeliev
wooden
.

what
's
a
talent
filmmak
like
peter
medak
-lrb-
``
the
rule
class
,
''
``
the
kray
,
''
``
let
him
have
It
''
-rrb-
do
direct
thi
tripe
,
I
wonder
.

It
's
an
unfortun
trend
,
thi
:
once-tal
director
throw
in
the
towel
and
lend
their
name
to
unchalleng
horror
flick
like
``
speci
II
.
''

last
year
peter
hyam
gave
us
``
the
relic
''
;
no
thank
necessari
there
.

and
the
first
``
speci
''
wa
helm
by
roger
donaldson
who
,
although
certainli
no
geniu
behind
the
camera
,
had
demonstr
much
better
judgment
with
hi
previou
choic
of
project
.

``
speci
II
''
is
worthless
.

wors
than
that
,
it
's
also
exploit
,
offens
,
and
insult
to
the
intellig
at
everi
turn
.

It
's
not
that
there
is
n't
anyth
posit
to
say
about
the
film
.

there
is
.

afterminut
,
it
end
.
