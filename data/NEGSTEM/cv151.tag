In
``
twilight
,
''
a
ex-alcohol
,
ex-cop
,
ex-husband
,
ex-private-ey
,
harri
ross
-lrb-
paul
newman
-rrb-
,
work
for
a
pair
of
age
hollywood
actor
,
catherin
-lrb-
susan
sarandon
-rrb-
and
jack
ame
-lrb-
gene
hackman
-rrb-
.

jack
is
be
blackmail
,
and
he
ask
harri
to
deliv
the
payoff
.

instead
of
the
blackmail
,
harri
find
a

ex-cop

As
more
bodi
begin
to
pile
up
,
harri
realiz
that
he
will
have
to
solv
the
disappear
of
catherin

year
earlier
to
find
out
who
's
will
to
kill
to
keep
that
secret
buri
.

newman
.

sarandon
.

hackman
.

with
an
a-list
cast
of
oscar
laureat
like
that
,
``
twilight
''
would
seem
veri
promis
.

howev
,
the
script
is
tire
and
predict
.

It
would
serv
well
as
a
tv-movie-of-the-week
,
possibl
with
some
1970
's
detect
hero
repris
hi
role
.

the
appeal
of
the
project
for
it
star
and
it
director
,
robert
benton
,
is
nostalgia
.

``
twilight
''
want
veri
much
to
be
a
1940
's
film
noir
with
alan
ladd
or
dick
powel
.

all
of
the
standard
trope
are
here
:
a
hard-boil
p.i.
among
the
rich
and
beauti
whose
glamour
hide
sinist
secret
,
a
femm
fatal
who
tempt
and
confound
the
hero
,
shadowi
figur
shoot
from
doorway
,
dead
bodi
confront
the
hero
at
everi
turn
,
cop
dog
hi
path
and
interf
with
hi
investig
.

the
script
offer
littl
origin
,
and
co-author
benton
and
richard
russo
seem
unawar
that
what
wa
origin
in
1948
is
a
clich
in
1998
.

elmer
bernstein
's
score
is
hauntingli
melod
and
could
have
been
drawn
note-for-not
from
a
vintag
noir
.

the
lead
actor
tri
hard-non
of
the
three
ha
everi
made
less
than
a
full
effort
,
even
when
burden
with
a
bad
script
.

they
tri
to
invest
everi
line
and
gestur
with
mean
,
and
they
creat
a
convinc
sens
of
the
relationship
between
the
main
charact
.

harri
is
fond
of
jack
but
is
in
love
with
catherin
.

jack
is
die
of
cancer
and
is
jealou
of
harri
's
love
for
catherin
.

catherin
teas
harri
and
enjoy
hi
attent
,
but
her
real
feel
are
hidden
beneath
a
carefully-maintain
veneer
.

``
twilight
''
want
to
be
character-driven
like
``
nobodi
's
fool
''
-lrb-
also
direct
by
benton
,
also
star
newman
,
base
on
a
novel
by
russo
-rrb-
wa
,
but
the
tire
script
give
the
actor
too
littl
to
work
with
.

``
twilight
''
also
squander
a
fine
support
cast
:
stockard
chan
-lrb-
harri
's
friend
on
the
polic
forc

rees
