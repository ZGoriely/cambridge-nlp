I
came
to
an
epiphani
while
watch
the
bachelor
,
an
innocuous-enough-on-the-surfac
romant
comedi
.

It
's
not
the
sort
of
film
in
which
one
would
expect
to
achiev
ani
moment
of
clariti
,
but
there
it
wa
nonetheless
.

I
sat
there
watch
thi
marshmallow
of
a
movi
unfold
when
suddenli
I
realiz
what
is
so
ridicul
wrong
with
the
entir
romant
comedi
genr
circa
1999
.

In
a
word
,
it
's
the
same
thing
that
's
wrong
with
so
mani
movi
circa
1999
:
write
.

more
to
the
point
,
it
's
the
refus
to
acknowledg
that
character
matter
when
you
're
tell
a
stori
about
a
relationship
.

the
bachelor
is
mere
the
latest
in
a
long
line
of
film
where
we
're
expect
to
get
dewy-ey
over
ani
pair
of
attract
,
pleasant
peopl
just
becaus
they
're
attract
and
pleasant
.

In
thi
particular
case
,
attract
and
pleasant
exhibit

is

It
's
a
scari

for

even

line
of

-rrb-
,
the
kind
where
a

learn

At
least
that
would
be
the
case
if
jimmi
were
n't
alreadi
a
world-class
altruist
.

screenwrit
steve
cohen
slide
into
the
stori
an
even
more
draconian
condit
in
the
will
:
If
jimmi
doe
n't
get
marri
,
not
onli
will
he
lose
all
the
money
,
but
the
famili
billiard
tabl
buis
will
be
sold
out
from
under
him
,
cost
hudr
of
job
.

from
the
outset
,
jimmi
's
motiv
is
n't
cash
;
it
's
the
livelihood
of
hi
devot
employe
.

It
's
almost
embarrass
for
hi
marit
misgiv
to
play
a
role
in
the
bachelor
's
plot
develop
.

By
ani
human
standard
,
the
guy
is
imposs
selfless
.

and
that
's
the
essenc
of
the
gutless
endem
to
film
like
the
bachelor
--
the
fear
of
give
the
charact
flaw
to
overcom
on
their
way
to
happi
.

there
's
never
ani
tension
between
the
two
star-cross
lover
,
becaus
there
's
no
sens
that
anyth
remot
signific
is
at
stake
.

the
blandli
nice
o'donnel
could
n't
pull
off
a
randi
cad
if
he
tri
,
so
the
filmmak
do
n't
even
let
him
;
zellweg
's
ann
may
have
issu
with
her
sickeningli
affection
parent
as
an
imposs
standard
to
live
up
to
,
but
no
one
dare
make
her
anyth
but
the
woman
-lrb-
lightli
-rrb-
wrong
.

and
forget
about
see
enough
of
jimmi
and
ann
togeth
to
feel
invest
in
their
potenti
reconcili
.

the
parad
of
sit-com
set
piec
had
better
be
damn
funni
,
sinc
they
're
all
that
stand
between
us
and
a
bliss
sweet
foregon
conclus
.

I
'll
admit
a
coupl
of
those
set
piec
are
amus
,
includ
ustinov
's
rant
about
procreat
and
a
restaur
full-to-burst
with
men
pop
question
and
champagn
cork
.

far
more
of
them
are
either
tediou
or
downright
ghastli
,
like
the
shudder-induc
sight
of
brook
shield
as
an
ici
fortune-hunt
or
the
hideou
collect
of
stereotyp
when
hundr
of
potenti
bride
gather
in
a
church
.

you
're
never
go
to
get
too
mani
raucou
belli
laugh
from
a
film
like
the
bachelor
,
but
that
's
not
the
real
problem
.

nor
is
it
the
real
problem
that
you
know
exactli
the
kind
of
warm-n-fuzzi
conclus
it
's
lead
up
to
.

the
problem
are
a
begin
and
middl
that
are
equal
warm-n-fuzzi
--
there
's
no
spark
,
no
energi
,
no
human
.

It
's
an
emot
pud
guarante
not
to
offend
ani
consum
's
digest
.

We
've
reach
a
point
where
our
proxi
for
cinemat
romant
wish
fulfil
do
n't
even
have
a
puls
.

the
bachelor
is
love
among
the
mannequin
.
