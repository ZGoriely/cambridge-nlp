and
,
onc
again
,
we
have
one
of
the
worst
film
of
the
year
.

the
trend
of
the
moment
--
and
bear
in
mind
it
's
a
trend
not

,
and
if
you

you
'll
recal
it
embodi
the

of
a

an

who
ha
transpir
the
ultim
punish
:
He
's
been
sent

todd
mcfarlan
,
the
creator
of
the
spawn
comic
book
,
must
have
had
a
tough
time
sit
through
spawn
,
for
hi
creativ
and
theme
about

and
loss
of
ident
were
all
be
jettison
in
favor
of
reliabl
special

over

not

the
stori
,
about
a
bewild
individu
who
must
take
on
a
group
of
bad
guy
and
find
himself
in
the
process
is
realiz
in
such
a
sordid
,
incap
manner
,
it
becom
indigest
after
a
while
.

everi
charact
in
thi
film
is
lifeless
,
vacuou
and
seemingli
written
by
a
depress
colleg
student
.

the
stori
begin
,
like
in
everi
superhero
movi
in
thi
age
,
with
a
man
live
an
idyl
life
.

Al
simmon

and
is
content
with
the
job
hi
boss
,
jason
wynn
-lrb-
martin
sheen
-rrb-
,
provid
him
.

the
next
element
in
the
film
is
the
part
when
thing
go
awri
.

and
as
expect
,
everyon
turn
the
tabl
on
poor
al.
.

As
the
two
are
investig
their
latest
mission
at
some
sort
of
biolog
weapon
plant
,
Al
is
befriend
by
jason
,
and
die
in
a
gori
and
truli
sicken
scene
.

inevit
,
it
lead

to
the
conclus
that
he

jason

when

to
command
the
devil
's
armi
to
take
over
the
world
and
he
get
to

So
,
our
pal
Al
ha
been
uplift
to
hell
,
and
while
hi
transform
from
normal
guy
to
spawn
take
place
,
hi
ol'
partner
terri
form
a
relationship
with
hi
wife
.

time
pass
.

and
now
spawn
is
present
in
the
grotesqu
inner
citi
,
the
ghetto
where
cog
-lrb-
nicol
williamson
-rrb-
teach
spawn
how
to
util
hi
neat
artifact
,
hi
motorbik
,
armor
,
etc.
.
.

thi
charact
is
mere
a
poor
man
's
obi
wan
kenobi
without
all
the
mytholog
hoopla
.

now
the
stage
is
set
spawn
,
the
new
`
enemi
of
evil
'
Vs
evil
.

and
evil
take
the
cake
,
doubtlessli
.

john
leguizamo
's
delici
heinou
perform
as
the
injuri
clown
work
for
wynn
is
the
film
's
relief
point
.

all
thi
anguish
,
pain
,
half-bak
theme
and
putrid
action
scene
are
invis
to
leguizamo
,
who
steal
the
show
and
deriv
joy
from
hi
charact
,
which
is
basic
a
compil
of
so-so
one
liner
.

and
then
there
's
martin
sheen
.

whichev
way
you
look
you
will
find
carv
board
near
hi
piti
and
downright
appal
last
two
year
.

hi
select
call
for
an
immedi
fire
of
hi
agent
.

As
the
megalomaniac
boss
,
hi
caricatur
play
like
a
bad
dream
out
of
a
b-movi
,
scrambl
,
and
left
in
the
shelf
to
rot
.

thi
is
the
man
that
star
in
film
such
as
apocalyps
now
and
wall
street
.

I
'd
never
thought
I
'd
be
say
thi
,
but
at
thi
junctur
,
charli
sheen
's
career
is
in
better
shape
.

spawn
is
a
movi
in
which
realism
,
or
even
an
attempt
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
problem
of
the
hero
and
real
life
is
identifi
.

for
most
of
the
film
the
vapid
michael
jai
white
consum
hi
time
ogl
,
jump
through
roof
,
and
perform
all
kind
of
acrobat
exercis
which
even
batman
and
robin
accomplish
better
.

It
constantli
remind
us
we
were
watch
a
superhero
movi
--
a
veri
bad
superhero
movi
.

continu
the
film
kept
on
depend
on
special
effect
,
and
sadli
,
thi
is
how
pictur
are
be
made
.

perhap
no
other
movi
better
than
spawn
illustr
the
deterior
of
cinema
through
comput
wizardri
.

the
filmmak
seem
to
have
forgotten
everi
human
element
possibl
.

the
qualiti
of
thi
film
is
abysm
and
insult
.

It
is
percept
that
director
mark
dipp
,
attempt
to
touch
the
psycholog
chord
that
tim
burton
's
batman
did
touch
,
the
desper
of
a
man
whose
life
ha
all
but
evapor
in
one
spontan
act
.

but
bruce
wayn
had
human
element
to
him
.

He
wa
pensiv
,
resourc
and
had
relationship
,
which
made
our
perspect
on
him
equal
human
.

the
charact
of
Al
simmon
seem
to
be
long
for
a
drastic
chang
,
as
if
he
's
fatigu
about
be
normal
.

and
as
all
superhero
,
batman
,
superman
,
the
phantom
,
they
must
possess
an
element
of
normal
civilian
to
make
us
think
they
are
extraordinari
.

none
of
thi
is
present
in
spawn
.

the
fight
sequenc
are
weakli
execut
,
the
dialogu
is
penny-dread
and
the
art
direct
an
odiou
duplic
of
blade
runner
'S
.

As
an
exampl
of
thi
film
's
vastli
creativ
imagin
the
writer
of
spawn
decid
to
includ
a
poor
orphan
boy
who
is
abandon
and
beaten
,
and
then
rescu
by
spawn
,
so
our
emot
tend
to
be
a
littl
more
sympathet
.

admittedli
,
I
did
laugh
onc
in
the
film
,
and
that
's
when
todd
mcfarlan
show
up
in
an
unexpect
cameo
as
a
bum
.

It
is
no
wonder
whi
so
american
children
grow
up
with
no
engross
for
art
or
literatur
.

besid
blame
a
larg
portion
of
it
on
the
laughabl
school
system
,
I
condemn
the
other
part
to
garbag
like
spawn
.

movi
that
present
no
admir
,
no
captiv
,
no
rich
and
vagu
interest
in
what
children
are
be
subject
to
.

and
kid
will
continu
to
see
film
like
spawn
,
simpli
becaus
they
are
unabl
to
differenti
what
make
an
imagin
,
wondrou
film
from
an
insipid
and
wast
one
.

children
are
not
muppet
.

and
spawn
unapologet
target
children
.
