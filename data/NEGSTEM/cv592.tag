and
if
so
,
what
is

now
for

bad

the
entir

of

is
base
almost
wholeheartedli
on
outdat

preposter
nation

martian

.

the

the
centerpiec
of
the

,
reveal
some
of
the
most
harebrain
sci-fi
pabulum
the
screen
ha
wit
.

borrow
idea
from
such
film
as
``
robinson
cruso
on
mar
''
-lrb-
1964
-rrb-
,
quatermass
and
the
pit
-lrb-
1967
-rrb-
,
``
2001

,
and
even
mario

``

the
vampir

`
terror

'
-rrb-
-lrb-
1965
-rrb-
,
``
mission
to
mar
''
is
a
hodgepodg
of
idea
that
do
n't
add
up
to
a
satisfi
whole
.

while
some
sequenc
are
wonder
handl
and
execut
,
the
film
remain
flat
and
un-involv
.

So
much
time
is
give
to
establish
the
lead
charact
in
the
film
,
but
to
no
good
use
.

the
perform
are
all
workmen
like
,
with
onli
don
cheadl
-lrb-
as
luc
-rrb-
carri
ani
sort
of
real
chemistri
.

gari
sinis
is
wast
in
role
that
requir
him
to
look
as
if
he
is
experienc
sleep
deprav
.

and
the
mistaken
idea
of
have
jerri
o'connel
-lrb-
as
phil
ohlmyer
-rrb-
play
hi
part
for
comic
relief
is
just
too
pain
to
excus
.

and
the
less
said
about
tim
robbin
call
in
from
home
perform
the
better
.

He
's
just
have
too
much
fun
here
to
give
a
damn
.

the
script
ha
a
few
laps
,
name
that
after
discov
sever
breach
in
the
hull
of
the
ship
caus
by
a
meteorit
shower
,
no
one
think
of
check
the
fuel
tank
or
the
remaind
of

thi

lead

our
hero

abandon

also
,
when

charact
sacrific
himself
,
the
charact
take
on
a
religi
demeanor
that
is
complet
at
odd
with
the
situat
.

but
the
biggest
offenc
in
the
film
is
the
horrid
,
intrus
score
by
ennio
morricon
.

subtleti
is
non-exist
here
.

In
fact
in
some
scene
the
music
becom
so
extravag
that
dialogu
is
almost
drown
out
.

the
onli
sequenc
in
which
the
score
almost
work
is
dure
the
protract
meteorit
shower
.

the
pace
of
the
film
is
veri
leisur
.

after
the
open
introduct
of
the
charact
-lrb-
which
last
a
fullminut
-rrb-
,
we
are
final
drop
onto
the
martian
surfac
.

then
,
there
is
anoth
long
paus
in
the
plot
for
more
charact
develop
,
includ
an
elabor
danc
sequenc
in
zero
graviti
.

the
film
could
lose
about
30
minut
and
actual
gain
some
momentum
.

there
are
so
mani
scene
of
talk
head
,
discuss
what
we
alreadi
know
is
go
to
happen
,
that
it
drag
the
film
to
a
dead
stop
.

the
good
news
is
that
the
film
is
absolut
sumptuou
to
look
at
.

the
vista
of
the
planet
mar
are
majest
and
awe
inspir
.

the
design
of
the

are
all

,
with
a
level
of
realism
that
ha
n't
been
seen
sinc
``

A
space
odyssey
''
.

the
visual
effect
are
just
stun
,
from
the
space
walk
sequenc
,
to
the
visual
of
evolut
on
earth
.

the
onli
fault
come
with
the
martian
themselv
,
which
look
more
like
someth
out
of
a
plastic
model

than
someth
from
