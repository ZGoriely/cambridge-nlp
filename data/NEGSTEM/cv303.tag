the
titl
is
taken
from
the
write
of
ralph
waldo
emerson
describ
the
life
of
a
travel
as
`
anywher

here
.
'

there
is
n't
one
thing
about
thi
mother-daught
relationship
melodrama
that
felt
honest
.

It
reli
on
a
contriv
minor
charact
to
tell
both
mother

wa
obviou
to
do
in

to
straighten
out
their
dysfunct
live
,
as
for
some
reason
they
could
n't
figur
it
out
for
themselv
.

If
the
film
look

,
that
is
becaus
``

went
over
the

ground
but
wa
fortun
to
be
more
comic

perform
,
in
which
they
were
fortun
to
have
a
much
sharper

to
work
with
.

alvin
sargent
's
script
wa
weak
and
annoyingli
claustral
.

wayn

-rrb-
inept

made
a
weak

even
weaker

but
the
transit
of
her
life
into
beverli
hill
had
no
feel
of
realiti
,
as
everyth
seem
stage
and
unemot
.

when
she
learn
her
cousin

,
who
happen
to
be
her
best
friend
die
in

accid
back

she
return
for
the
funer
and
in
those
reunion
scene
it
wa
n't
clearli
shown
whi
she
want
to
stay
there
,
and
for
that
matter
,
it
wa
never
made
clear
whi
the
mother
want
to
leav
so
badli
.

the
film
is
one
big
battl
of
will
between
mother
and
daughter
over
their
dream
.

I
guess
what
the
filmmak
is
tri
to
say
,
is
that
mom
is
a
bad
dreamer
and
the
daughter
is
the
observ
one
,
abl
to
recogn
mother
's
fault
when
not
in
grow
pain
and
in
need
of
parent
herself
.

mother
ha
a
seri
of
setback
,
like
be
dump
by
her
dream-boat
dentist
-lrb-
bochner
-rrb-
she
met
on
the
beach
,
and
wit
her
daughter
mimic
her
whini
optimist
say
when
tri
out
for
an
act
part
.

but
mother
learn
that
her
daughter
ha
grown-up
and
is
independ
and
that
she
ha
to
stop
live
her
life
through
her
.

she
learn
thi
when
the
same
wise
cop
who
told
ann
what
to
do
,
is
about
to
ticket
her
and
thi
time
will
remind
the
mother
of
the
right
thing
to
do
.

thi
of
cours
result
in
the
corni
end
,
show
that
mom
's
heart
wa
alway
in
the
right
place
,
onli
she
went
about
it
in
the
wrong
way
.

thi
wa
just
one
of
those
film
where
you
want
to
be
anywher
but
in
the
theater
where
thi
film
is
show
.
