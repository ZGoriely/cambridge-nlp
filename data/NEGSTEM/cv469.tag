hollywood
never
fail
to
astound
me
.

everi
time
I
think
those
coked-up
littl
bugger
have
hit
rock
bottom
;
they
come
up
with
a
new
excav
tool
.

I
wa
truli
convinc
that
``
wild
wild
west
''
mark
1999
studio
filmmak
at
it
most
hapless
,
but
then
along
come
``
end
of
day
''
to
prove
me
wrong
.

thi
big
budget
,
brain
dead
apocalypt
thriller
bludgeon
it
audienc
with
overwrought
music
,
grisli
violenc
,
explos
galor
and
lot
of
cheesi
special
effect
.

the
result
?

noth
but
groan
and
yawn
.

even
the
devil
himself
is
unabl
to
produc
a
decent
scare
in
thi
festiv
of
the
inept
.

At
the
veri
least
,
``
end
of
day
''
should
have
done
us
the
courtesi
of
be
bad-enough-to-be-good
,
but
it
ca
n't
even
manag
that
.

It
's
just
lousi
.

arnold
schwarzenegg
,
still
recov
from
heart
problem
and
``
batman
&
robin
,
''
play
an
ex-cop
turn
secur
agent
or
bodyguard
or
someth
.

along
with
hi
obligatori
comic
relief
partner
-lrb-
kevin
pollak
,
imperson
matthew
perri
's
chandler
charact
from
``
friend
''
-rrb-
,
he
get
involv
in
some
major
leagu
supernatur
hoodoo
.

It
seem
that
satan
-lrb-
gabriel
byrn
-rrb-
get
a
shot
at
world
domin
onli
onc
everi
thousand
year
-lrb-
and
here
I
thought
he
'd
pull
it
off
with
the
republican
landslid
of
'
94
-rrb-
.

If
he
ha
sex
with
20-year
old
christin
york
-lrb-
robin
tunney
-rrb-
,
``
the
chosen
one
,
''
their
child
will
be
the
antichrist
,
or
at
least
a
brat
.

Ah
,
but
thi
deal
ha
more
catch
than
a
new
year
's
eve
pass
from
a
halfway
hous
.

the
unholi
union
must
take
place
on
decemb
31
,
1999
-lrb-
you
see
,
999
is
just
666
turn
upsid
down
-rrb-
,
but
onli
between
11
p.m.
and
midnight
-lrb-
no
wonder
thi
guy
is
so
cranki
-rrb-
.

and
if
the
chosen
one
is
given
refug
in
a
church
,
the
devil
wo
n't
know
where
she
is
,
becaus
he
ca
n't
see
into
the
sanctuari
.

you
know
,
it
's
kind
of
like
superman
's
x-ray
vision
and
lead
wall
,
onli
evil
.

A
group
of
guerrilla
cathol
priest
decid
the
best
way
to
stop
the
situat
is
by
kill
the
girl
.

arnold
choos
to
save
the
girl
and
kick
the
hell
out
of
satan
,
if
you
'll
pardon
the
express
.

and
kevin
meet
up
with
an
explod
van
and
ha
to
make
some
decis
of
hi
own
.

Oh
,
the
anguish

Oh

Oh

In

in
for
a
close

of

director
peter

is
just
the
man
to
take
marlow
's
script
and
make
it
even
more
self-import
,
murki
and
annoy
.

with

a

of
ridicul

set

punctuat
with

explos
.

eager
to
satisfi
arnold
's
core
audienc
,
he
even
throw
in
a
few
pair
of
breast
as
well
.

what
a
guy
.

had
the
film
deliv
some
decent
scare
,
or
even
maintain
a
consist
omin
tone
,
the
bombast
clich
might
have
been
toler
,
but
``
end
of
day
''
is
simpli
a
flaccid
special
effect
show
.

the
cast
is
just
as
ineffect
.

In
hi
earli
scene
,
gabriel
byrn
attempt
to
invest
beelzebub
with
some
panach
,
but
he
all
too
soon
turn
into
just
anoth
standard
issu
monster
.

kevin
pollak
come
and
goe
quickli
,
robin
tunney
come
off
like
a
bargain
basement
winona
ryder
and
as
for
arnold
,
well
he
's
a
better
actor
than
casper
van
dien
.

that
should
count
for
someth
.

way
back
in
the
aftermath
``
the
exorcist
''
and
``
the
omen
,
''
supernatur
swill
like
``
end
of
day
''
might
have
pass
muster
as
a
b-movi
.

but
that
wa
then
and
thi
is
now
.

``
the
x-file
''
and
``
buffi
the
vampir
slayer
''
deliv
real
scare
on
a
weekli
basi
and
,
if
we
want
to
see
the
devil
,
all
we
have
to
do
is
flip
on
``
the
700
club
''
and
take
a
gander
at
pat
robertson
's
grin
maw
.

after
endur
``
end
of
day
,
''
all
I
can
say
is
``
get
thee
behind
me
,
satan
.
''

and
while
you
're
at
it
,
get
thee
a
better
agent
as
well
