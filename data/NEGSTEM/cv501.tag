comment
:
the
EX
is
a
veri
bad
movi
.

I
have
n't
seen
a
turkey
of
thi
magnitud
in
quit
a
while
.

I
kept
vacil
,
howev
,
between
give
the
exstarsfor
it
sheer

it
campi
humor
-lrb-
ultim
,
I
decid
to
split
the
differ
and
give
it
two
star
-rrb-
.

As
summar
briefli
in
the
synopsi
,
thi
is
yet
anoth
spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-reveng
type
movi
.

I
'm
not
sure
how
mani
film
have
been
produc
sinc
fatal
attract
which
use
thi
tire
storylin
,
but
it
seem
like
10,000,000,000
.

the
EX
,
howev
,
though
follow
mani
of
the
standard
clich
of
thi
thriller
subgenr
,
differ
slightli
from
the
norm
in
that
,
at
least
,
it
doe
n't
take
itself
too
serious
like
so
mani
other
dud
do
-lrb-
malici
and
stalk
are
two
exampl
which
come
to
mind
-rrb-
.

those
involv
in
the
movi
realiz
they
're
in
a
turkey
,
appar
,
and
turn
in
hammi
perform
which
compliment
the
ludicr
dialogu
contain
within
the
script
.

the
EX
's
storylin
,
as
I
said
,
incorpor
mani
clich
predomin
in
film
of
it
natur
;
howev
,
the
plot
is
so
overwrought
and
unbeliev
that
,
after
a
while
,
the
viewer
must
accept
that
logic
doe
not
oper
in
the
realm
of
the
movi
.

diedr
,
david
's
first
wife
,
kill
and
kill
and
kill
,
for
exampl
,
without
ever
have
to
worri
about
polic
investig
and
the
like
-lrb-
it
's
not
as
though
she
's
bright
enough
not
to
leav
fingerprint
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
-rrb-
.

david
and
hi
new
wife
molli
have
an
incred
difficult
time
understand
whi
michael
,
their
son
,
ha
emot
problem
,
specif
hi
inabl
to
control
hi
anger
.

though
david
smoke
like
tomorrow
will
never
come
and
blow
up
at
peopl
everi
other
minut
in
the
movi
,
the
connect
between
him
and
hi
son
is
not
made
.

molli
is
easili
sway
by
diedr
into
believ
she
's
a
child
psychologist
and
allow
the
dement
woman
to
spend
time
with
her
son
.

time
and
time
again
,
thing
do
not
add
up
in
thi
movi
.

If
a
viewer
ca
n't
accept
thi
fact
,
then
he
will
defin
not
like
the
EX
.

If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
can
appreci
the
movi
for
it
campi
,
then
he
'll
probabl
like
it
much
better
.

I
do
n't
mean
to
necessarili
suggest
,
howev
,
that
the
EX
is
a
memor
exercis
in
camp
.

even
when
view
from
an
it
's
-
so-bad-it
's
-
good
angl
,
thi
movi
is
n't
all
that
success
.

the
EX
doe
have
it
moment
,
though
,
almost
all
of
which
involv
yanci
butler
-lrb-
the
psychot
diedr
-rrb-
and
nick
mancuso
-lrb-
david

.

these
two
actor
turn
in
decidedli
hammi
perform
which
,
oftentim
,
elicit
chuckl
from
the
audienc
.

the
truli
aw
line
written
for
them
help
thi
humor
along
.

the
larger
portion
of
bad
dialogu

everi

she

when
she

wish
to
use
to

on

the

with
a
crowbar
and
state
``

''

Or
how
about
when
diedr
take
out
her
therapist
in
anoth
ridicul
scene
?

-lrb-
diedr

therapist
wish
to
have
her
recommit

so
she
decid
to
visit
diedr
,

in
her
new

,
that
it
's

therapist
typic
are
cataton
brain-dead
in
these
movi
-rrb-
.

have
success
snuf
the
woman
out
,
diedr
look
at
the
bodi
and
say
:
``
what
wa
it
that
you
alway
said
to
me
at
the
end
of
each
session
,
dr.
jone
?
''

Oh
,
that
's
right
.

`
I
'm
sorri
,
but
your
time
is
up
!
'
''
''

thi
is
what
pass
for
humor
in
the
film
.

the
audienc
doe
n't
necessarili
laugh
but
groan
-lrb-
the
type
of
groan
that
suggest
the
audienc
ca
n't
believ
they
're
watch
thi
crap
--
although
watch
it
they
are
-rrb-
.

nick
mancuso
's
chainsmok
,
nervous-wreck
charact
doe
not
have
the
cheesi
line
that
butler
's
charact
deliv
,
but
hi
ridicul
overdon
perform
provid
for
some
better
comic
relief
.

In
between
drag
off
hi
cigarett
,
for
instanc
,
in
one
of
the
movi
's
best
scene
,
david
tri
to
explain
to
hi
lawyer
what
a
creep
hi
ex-wif
is
.

In
exagger
exasper
,
he
nearli
shout
``
the
woman
is
a
cuckoo-bird
!
''

-lrb-
trust
me
,
it
is
funni
in
context
.
-rrb-

and
so
,
the
movi
continu
until
it
pain
obviou
conclus
.

I
wo
n't
reveal
the
end
specif
-lrb-
though
anyon
remot
familiar
with
thriller
of
thi
type
could
probabl
guess
the
end
just
from
thi
film
review
-rrb-
,
but
I
will
say
that
the
EX
ha
one
of
the
biggest
fire
hazard
appear
recent
in
film
.

molli
and
david
own
a
cabin
that
becom
engulf
by
flame
in
approxim
three
second
!

molli
,
at
one
point
in
the
film
,
not-so-brilliantli
observ
,
after
discov
diedr
ha
move
into
an
apart
across
from
her
famili
's
to
spi
upon
them
,
that
``
she
's
crazi
.
''

you
'd
be
pretti
crazi
too
if
you
'd
rent
thi
turkey
.

I
'd
avoid
it
unless
it
's
on
TV
and
you
come
across
it
.

If
you
do
,
you
may
want
to
watch
it
,
groan
at
the
bad
punchlin
and
stupid
plot
,
and
feel
good
that
you
did
n't
spend
money
rent
it
.
