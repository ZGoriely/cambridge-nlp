,
it

In
thi
decad
christoph

becam
associ
with
film
with
low
budget

veri
often
such

were

which
meant
that
the
fan

genr
learn
the
hard

what
to

whether
it

,
terribl
miscast
or
simpl
bad
luck
is
n't
important-th
end
result
wa
almost
alway
horribl
.

the
same
can
be
said
for
fortress
,
1993
scienc
fiction
film
direct
by
stuart
gordon
,
director
who
creat

the
movi
is

after
rather

and
some
interest
special
effect
that
depict
the
futurist
set
of
prison
,
thi
film
soon
start
sink
into
mediocr
.

the
reason
is
in
the
screenplay
that
quickli
degener
into
whole
seri
of

movi
clich
and
situat
that
are
pain

By
the

those
situat
not

begin
to
look

utterli

Of

never

the
initi
interest
plot
is
done
even
more
wrong
by
stereotyp
charact

play
by
not

actor

lori
laughlin
,
although
physic
attract

kurtwood
smith
as
prison
warden
is
rather
uninspir

capabl
of
solid

yet
forgett
perform
.

lambert
's
perform
is
also
good
,
but
even
the
bigger
talent
could
n't
help
thi
film
,
destin
to
end
in
