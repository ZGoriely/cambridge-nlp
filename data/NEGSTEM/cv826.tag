I
've
alway
prefer
mushroom
to
blotter
acid
.

drop
acid
is
like
ride
a
roller
coaster
blindfold
;
you
have
no
idea
where
the
peak
and
valley
are
,
no
idea
when
the
next
terrifi
decent
will
send
your
stomach
into
your
throat
,
and
no
idea
how
long
the
ride
will
last
.

then
there
's
the
hard
knot
in
your
gut
and
the
clench
teeth
that
come
with
ingest
a
strychnine-lac
dose
.

mushroom
,
on
the
other
hand
,
offer
the
psychedel
equival
of
a
leisur
ride
on
a
ferri
wheel
:
a
steadi
,
reassur
assent
,
a
short
period
of
thrill
motion
and
color
,
and
then
a
smooth
land
.

acid
is
for
daredevil
;
mushroom
are
for
refin
seeker
of
joy
.

My
point
is
that
in
fear
and
loath
IN
la
vega
,
director
terri
gilliam
ha
made
an
acid
movi
,
when
I
wish
he
would
have
made
a
mushroom
movi
.

that

is

thompson
's
book
,
besid
be
a
hilari
read
,
ha
stood
the
test
of
time
as
an
import
histor
document
.

It
simultan
expos
the
60
's
drug
cultur
for
the
sham
that
it
wa
and
expos
la
vega
as
the
place
where
the
american
dream
came
to
die
.

pontif
all
you
want
about
how
the
film
illustr
thompson
's
messag
,
but
the
truth
is
that
,
strip
to
it
bare
essenti
,
what
gilliam
ha
wrought
is
a
drug
comedi
.

It
's
a
cheech
and
chong
movi
.

you
're
there
to
watch
depp
and
del
toro
ingest
a
lot
of
chemic
and
then
laugh
at
the
result
:
see
johnni
take
drug
,
see
johnni
fall
down
.

there
's
noth
wrong
with
thi
concept
,
but
gilliam
tri
too
hard
.

thi
is
a
frantic
movie-al
sweati
close-up
,
wide-angl
lens
,
dutch
tilt
and
other-worldli
light
scheme
.

there
are
time
when
gilliam
realli
doe
put
a
convinc
represent
of
an
acid
trip
on
the
screen
.

but
to
what
end
?

much
of
the
dialogu
come
verbatim
from
thompson
's
book
,
and
there
are
some
priceless
comic
observ
.

but
you
're
hard
press
to
hear
or
digest
them
amidst
all
the
jumbl
camera
work
.

thi
bring
us
to
the
perform
,
which
strike
me
as
all
wrong
.

depp
play
thompson
as
groucho
mark
filter
through
georg
C.
scott
in
patton-a
gimmicki
perform
which
work
against
the
bite
satir
of
thompson
's
dialogu
.

In
between
hi
sever
puke
scene
,
del
toro
fare
better
as
dr.
gonzo
,
but
he
also
mumbl
and
sputter
so
mani
of
hi
line
that
their
weight
is
lost
.

watch
these
two
made
me
wish
that
the
movi
had
been
made
twenti
year
ago
,
with
dan
akroyd
and
john
belushi
as
the
leads-now
that
would
have
been
someth
to
see
.

It
's
interest
to
note
that
alex
cox
,
credit
as
a
co-writ
on
the
screenplay
,
wa
origin
slate
to
direct
befor
gilliam
took
over
.

As
much
of
a
fan
as
I
am
of
gilliam
's
work
,
cox
would
have
been
the
better
choic
.

sid
and
nanci
,
cox
's
best
work
,
cover
essenti
the
same
subject
matter
,
but
cox
wa
abl
to
pull
back
and
allow
the
charact
of
sid
viciou
and
nanci
spungen
to
carri
the
film
.

gilliam
commit
the
compound
sin
of
over-direct
hi
film
while
be
uncertain
of
hi
purpos
.

what
kind
of
movi
wa
he
tri
to
make
,
anyway
?

It
doe
n't
tri
to
be
a
cautionari
tale
,
and
it
doe
n't
work
as
broad
comedi
.

If
he
had
consid
more
care
hi
purpos
,
the
result
would
have
been
a
much
more
interest
film
.

but
I
do
n't
want
to
be
too
hard
on
it
.

there
are
some
truli
funni
moment
,
and
if
you
're
in
a
good
enough
mood
you
might
get
a
kick
out
of
it
.

I
do
,
howev
,
recommend
watch
fear
and
loath
IN
la
vega
under
the
influenc
of
your
favorit
control
substance-i
guarante
it
will
enhanc
the
effect
.
