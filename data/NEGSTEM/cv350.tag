in
one
of
the

scene
of
thi

let
me
clear
thing
up
for
you
cupcak
,
thi
is
n't
a
bad
b-movi
,
it
's
a
realli
bad
b-movi
.

So
bad
,
it
's
almost
good
.

almost
,
but
not
quit
.

the
movi
start
off
in
the
1950
's
with
space
alien
send
a
botch
experi
down
to
earth
.

It
is
a
bunch
of
slug-lik
creatur
that
kill
peopl
and
take
over
their
bodi
.

the
slug
'
first
and
onli
victim
in
the
fifti
is
cryogen
frozen
where
he
is
of
no
danger
to
anybodi
.

that
is
,
until
two

He
,
and
the
slug

,
promptli
begin
wreak
havoc
and
turn
more
co-e

It
more
or
less
fall
on
the
four
of
them
to
make
the
world
safe
again
from
the
evil
slug
.

the

B
.

the
stori
is
wors
.

and
the
special
effect
are
somewher
between
an
old
rerun
of
star
trek
and
what
you
see
in
a
home
movi

It
had
absolut
noth
to
do
with
the
stori
--
but
I
like
it
.

actual
,
it
wa
the
high
point
of
the
movi
for
me
.

Of
cours
,
that
is
n't
realli
say
much
.

the
stori
move
around
in
a
hap
hazard
fashion
.

which
give
it
a
leg
up
on
some
other
horror
film
.

unlik
most
movi
of
thi
genr
,
there
actual
is
a
stori
.

not
a
great
one
,
but
it
is
there
.

thi
is
one
in
a
long
line
of
movi
from
the
1980
's
that
were
thrown
togeth
