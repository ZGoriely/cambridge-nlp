that
they
can
remov
insidi
asbesto
fiber
from
a
victorian
hospit
facil
in
a
week
.

erect
in
1871
,
desert
and
decompos
sinc
1985
,
the
danver
mental
hospit
,
is
one
of
the
most
malevol
``
locat
''
ever
chosen
for
a
film
.

the
structur
is
so
massive-with
it
labyrinth
of
rubble-strewn
corridor
,
collaps
floor
,
stagnant
pool
of
water
,
isol
cell
,
and
omin
surgic
chamber
where
experiment
pre-front
lobotomi
were
performed-that
their
task
seem
imposs
within
that
time
frame
.

and
each
member
of
their
inexperienc
crew

stephan

demon
as
,
one
by
one
,
their
mind
seem
to
be
affect
by
the
grim
area
in
which
they
're
work
.

the
film
's
titl
is
deriv
from
salvag
reel-to-reel
audio-record
session
involv
the
demon
possess
of
a
young
woman
who

multipl
person
.

By
the
time
session

occur
so
do
dread
disast
.

filmmak
brad
anderson
obvious
envis
thi
as
a
gruesom
chainsaw-massacre-typ
ghost
stori
but
the
script
lack
structur
and
is
n't
particularli
scari
.

the
conclus
is
more
ludicr
than
convinc
.

silli
me
...
at
first
,
I
thought
that
the
origin
name
of
the
danver
lunat
asylum
bore
some
refer
to
mrs.
danver
,
the
creepi
housekeep
play
by

that
also
involv
