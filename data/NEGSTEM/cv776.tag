the
most
depress
thing
about
the
depressingli
pedestrian
jame
bond
film
``
the
world
is
not
enough
''
is
it
final
frame
:
white
letter
on
a
black
background
proclaim
``
jame
bond
will
return
.
''

Oh
I
certainli
hope
not
.

with
pierc
brosnan
in
hi
third
and
reportedli
last
go-round
as
jame
bond
007
,
``
the
world
is
not
enough
''
is
the
best
exampl
to
date
that
''
'
enough
''
is
enough
.

In
thi
,
the
19th
chapter
in
the
seemingly-endless
franchis
featur
ian
fleme
's
debonair
british
secret
agent
who
like
hi
martini
--
and
hi
nemes
--
shaken
not
stir
,
the
sub-inspir
screenwrit
have
chosen
to
rehash
all
of
the
setup
,
stunt
,
and
sexi
encount
of
the
previou
18
bond
flick
rather
than
come
up
with
anyth
the
slightest
bit
origin
.

We
've
got
previously-us
speedboat
chase
,
ski
chase
,
and
sticki
situat
aboard
nuclear
submarin
.

We
've
got
a
coupl
of
hot-to-trot
babe
without
an
ounc
of
act
abil
between
them
.

We
've
got
a
post-cold
war
megalomaniac
bent
on
world
domin
slash
destruct
-lrb-
here
play
by
a
skinhead
robert
carlyl
with
mean
,
lean
panach
-rrb-
.

and
,
as
ha
been
the
case
sinc
1977
's
``
the
spi
who
love
Me
,
''
we
've
got
a
plot
that
ha
noth
whatsoev
to
do
with
anyth
conceiv
by
mr.
fleme
.

We
've
also
got
a
main
titl
song
by
garbag
to
which
,
with
veri
littl
effort
,
you
can
fit
the
lyric
to
*
both
*
song
from
``
tomorrow
never
die
.
''

while
origin
wa
never
the
seri
'
strong
suit
,
the
film
were
almost
alway
fun
,
with
at
least
some
thought
go
into
the
nonstop
stunt
.

I
ca
n't
think
of
one
memor
set-piec
in
the
entir
--
and
veri
dull
--
``
the
world
is
not

''

In

``

''
and
the
``
28up
''
documentari
seri
-rrb-
take
embarrass
advantag
of
the
full
rang
of
bond
clich
.

you
get
the
``

plot
devic
--
you
know
the
scenario
:
the
bad
guy
ha
the
good
guy
at
hi
merci
yet
wax
poetic
just
long
enough
to
die
of
old
age
.

and
you
get
a
slew
of
high-pric
assassin
who
ca
n't
hit
a
barn
door
at
20
pace
:
in
the
film
's
open
minut
-lrb-
of
an
endless
128

,
bond
chase
a
sultri
sniper
along

the
leather-clad
love
fail
to
hit
bond

souped-up
``

later
,
she

hot

balloon
with
bond
dangl
from
a
guy
rope
beneath
her
but
is
still
unabl

him
out

these
reliabl

more

than
usual
sinc
there
are
no

than
