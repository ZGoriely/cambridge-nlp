it

the

the
onli
real
success
of
the
2001
``
planet

''
is
rick
baker
's
makeup
,
and
even
that
's
an
iffi
affair
.

No
attempt
wa
made
to
chang
the
human
white
of
the

eye
,
a
real
distract
amidst

as

are
given
the
most
impress
makeov
.

giamatti
look
more
like
a
skull
than
an
ape
and
the
femal
ape
are
too
human
to
be
given
sexual
appeal
.

but
is
undon
in

by
the

most
of
the
film
ha
a
set
bound
look
which
no
amount
of
mist
can
cover

the

's
citi
resembl

``

as
well
as
their

reminisc
of
eiko

work
on
coppola

``

''

that
orient

is
also

``

the

a
