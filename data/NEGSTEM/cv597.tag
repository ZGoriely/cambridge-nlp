In

the

slow
the

down

It

the

is
a

circa

kind
of

,
yet
it

but
we
can
see
that
there
happen
to
be

here

play
him
more
as
a
hip
,
sexual
dynamo
than
the
squar

he
imperson
in

.

He
's
cool
and

,
which
is
precis
the
kind
of
role
we
want
to
see
cruis
in

mi2
fall

on

dure
it
repetiti
third
act
,
which
is
essenti
one
hour
long
action
sequenc
that
just
wo
n't
stop
.

the
whole
thing
commenc
with
an
utterli
gener
gun
battl
-lrb-
the
first
gun
fight
in
the
film
-rrb-
,
which
realli
should
be
unheard
of
in
a
john
woo
film
,
but
ala
thi
particular
battl
could
've
been
stage
by
anyon
from
renni
harlin
to
joseph
merhi
-lrb-
of
cours
except
the
``
symbol
''
pigeon
who
seem
to
find
their
way
into
everi
john
woo
pictur
-rrb-
.

We
've
all
seen
guy
slide
across
the
floor
in
slo
mo
while
fire
a
gun
in
each
hand
.

It
is
n't
done
ani
differ
here
.

the
action
is
pure
hard
target
\
broken
arrow
theatric
with
noth
to
propel
it
but
the
appar
need
to
see
tom
cruis
drop
kick
face
less
villain
while
hi
hair
whip
stylishli
in
the
wind
.

He
's
cool
for
sure
but
he
's
made
to
be
as
empti
as
the
movi
.

the
actor
is
n't
use
so
much
for
hi
boyish
appeal
as
for
hi
chisel
look
;
he
smile
narcissist
into
the
camera
at
liter
ani
moment
,
be
it
dure
a
gunfight
,
befor
one
or
after
one
.

when
he
's
not
beam
away
,
he
's
stare
into
the
len
with
cold
eye
tri
to
look
mad
as
hell
,
but
woo
's
edit
serious
undermin
the
effort
.

He
fetish
cruis
's
angular
face
with
such
glee
that
it
turn
into
a
nake
gun
style
spoof
.

I
half
expect
cruis
to
peel
off
hi
facemask
and
reveal
that
he
's
realli
austin
power
.

In
a
classic
woo
action
moment
,
ethan
hunt
strut
past
a
fieri
doorway
glare
at
the
baddi
within
it
frame
like
a
pin-up
boy
angel
of
death
.

the
gunfight
turn
into
a
dare
escap
which
turn
into
a
reckless
mission
which
turn
into
a
motorcycl
attack
in
which
bad
guy
seem
to
angl
directli
for
cruis
to
kill
them
like
some
kind
of
mass
suicid
ritual
-lrb-
one
dumb
bastard
even
jump
hi
bike
over
the
gun
tote
cruis
,
basic
invit
our
handsom
hero
to
shoot
him
in
mid

which
he
doe
-rrb-
.

the
lead
bad
guy
-lrb-
play
by
the
appropri
british
dougray
scott
-rrb-
and
cruis
face
off
in
a
mental
defici
game
of
chickenon
motorcycl
.

though
instead
of
jump
off
to
the
side
at
the
last
moment
,
the
two
grown
men
leap
directli
into
the
other
give
each
other
a
mid

bear
hug
,
onli
to
fli
about
a
hundr
feet
-lrb-
still
in
bear

posit
-rrb-
,
land
on
a
beach
below
and
begin
a
mano-e-mano
fist
fight
that
end
with
the
bad
guy
pull
a
``
so
you
thought
I
wa
dead
...
''
.

not
to
worri
,
cruis
take
care
of
the
problem
without
even
break
a
sweat
.

what
a
hero
!

you
may
have
notic
that
I
opt
not
to
describ
an
iota
of
mi2
's
plot
.

My
reason
is
simpl
:
I
'm
not
sure
of
ani
good
it
would
do
.

the
film
itself
ha
absolut
no
concern
with
stori
,
onli
with
hurtl
forth
to
the
next
``
special
''
effect
.

I
wa
n't
kid
when
I
told
a
friend
of
mine
that
mi2
ha
less
plot
than
the
averag
aerosmith
video
.

nobodi
will
go
to
thi
for
the
plot
,
and
if
they
do
they
'll
sure
regret
it
.

As
summer
movi
evolv
-lrb-
or
devolv
-rrb-
charact
and
plot
have
becom
increasingli
whittl
down
to
nearli
noth
.

In
MI
,
the
plot
seem
to
be
built
around
brian
De
palma
's
-lrb-
that
film
's
director
-rrb-
stylist
flourish
,
while
in
mi2
the
plot
onli
serv
to
give
us
an
intermitt
breather
from
woo
's
non-stop
masturbatori
pandemonium
.

It
's
irrelev
in
everi
sens
,
as
is
charact
.

all
that
ultim
matter
are
those
peski
smoke
and
mirror
.
