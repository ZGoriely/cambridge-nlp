such
comparison
.

the
fact
is
that
there
is
yet
anoth
way
of
look
at
last
man
stand
,
which
is
as
the
first
film
version
of
the
stori
which
nod
to
the
_
real
_
sourc
materi
,
the
dashiel
hammett
novel
_

.

It
also
show
that
kurosawa
and
leon
knew
better
what
to
do
with
that
materi
than
hammett
himself
.

thi
time
around

the

By

director
walter

give
the
proceed
hi
usual
inject
of
steroid
,
includ
a
pair
of
gun
for
willi
which
have
the
abil
to
propel
an
assail
backward
with
suffici
thrust
to
achiev

,
but
at
least
he
doe
n't
tri
to
turn
the
stori
into
a
slasher
film
or
a
buddi
pictur
.

what
he
_
doe
_
do
is
nearli
as
big
a
mistak
,
and
that
is
to
provid
a
run
voice-ov
narrat
by
willi
which
ring
of
the
standard
hard-boil
style
of
pulp
detect
fiction
.

ye
,
that
narrat
is
full
of
clich
,
but
those
are
are
not
particularli
troubl
.

the
problem
is
that
both
yojimbo
and
A
fist
OF
dollar
succeed
larg
on
the
inscrut
of
their
lead
charact
.

they
were
a
mysteri
,
to
the
other
charact
in
the
film
and
to
the
audienc
,
their
motiv
never
entir
clear
even
after
they
have
act
,
and
that
qualiti
contribut
to
their
almost
mythic
statu
.

with
john
smith
's
voic
chatter
on
in
the
background
and
allow
us
into
hi
everi
thought
,
he
becom
more
mundan
,
just
anoth
tough
guy
tri
to
stay
aliv
.

It
feel
like
a
hammett
novel
,
all
right
,
and
hill
can
plead
faith
to
hi
text
for
hi
choic
,
but
it
simpli
doe
n't
work
.

the
narrat
allow
the
man
with
No
name
to
take
us
into
hi
confid
,
and
the
man
with
No
name
take
_
no
one
_
into
hi
confid
.

even
if
you
walk
into
last
man
stand
as
a
blank
slate
,
I
ca
n't
imagin
it
be
much
more
than
a
heavili
arm
minor
distract
.

willi
tone
down
hi
macho
swagger
as
the
taciturn
smith
,
but
there
is
still
a
level
on
which
he
alway
seem
like
he
is
count
on
be
tougher
than
everyon
els
rather
than
smarter
than
everyon
els
.

christoph
walken
play
doyl
's
brutal
henchman
as
a
slight
variat
on
hi
galleri
of
soft-spoken
psycho
,
and
there
is
n't
anoth
singl
charact
whom
make
even
the
slightest
impress
.

with
no
compel
antagonist
for
smith
,
there
is
no
build-up
toward
the
expect
showdown
,
and
when
it
doe
come
,
that
showdown
is
over
so
quickli
you
