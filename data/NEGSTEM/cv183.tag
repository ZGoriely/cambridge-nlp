A
big
remak
of
the
haunt

and
big
special
effect
.

So
what
do
they
all
amount
to
?

unfortun
for
us
,
a
big
bore
!

A
hotshot
doctor
bring
three
insomniac
to
an
old
,
spooki
mansion
for
control
test
.

unbeknownst
to
the
patient
,
the
good
doctor
is
actual
conduct
hi
own
cover
project
that
ha
to
do
with
the
psycholog
of
fear
.

thi
movi
just
did
n't
scare
me
one
bit
.

sure
,
it
creep
and
spook
me
out
a
littl
here
and
there
,
but
on
the
whole
,
it
took
waaaaay
too
long
to
get
go
,
provid
veri
littl
meat
in
the
plot
,
went
way
past
it
own
bedtim
,
and
basic
reli
on
grunt
,
the
mutter
of
children
's
voic
and
over-the-top
special
effect
,
to
scare
us
.

well
,
thi
film
did
n't
do
much
for
me
.

and
they
might
as
well
have
call
it
the
``
haunt
of
lili
taylor
''
,
sinc
she
's
basic
the
onli
charact
who
had
ani
real
depth
,
background
or
reason
to
be
in
the
hous
in
the
first
place
.

Do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
catherin
zeta
wa
sweet
window
dress
-lrb-
despit
my
continu
percept
of
her
faint
mustache-se
entrap
-rrb-
,
and
owen
wilson
wa
good
as
the
standard
``
comic
relief
''
,
but
come
on
peopl
,
if
you
're
go
to
have
us
sit
through
two
hour
in
a
theater
with
these
folk
,
how
'
bout
give
them
a
littl
more
than
one-lin
as
dimens
.

neeson
wa
also
wast
as
the
smart
,
british
guy
.

It
's
all
too
sad
,
caus
certainli
the
``
idea
''
seem
like
a
good
one
-lrb-
see
the
shine
-lrb-
9/10
-rrb-
for
a
close
to
perfect
exampl
of
a
creepi
gone
awri
-rrb-
,
but
the
stori
wa
thin
,
the
conclus
wa
laughabl
-lrb-
Be
gone
...
poof
!
-rrb-

and
the
special
effect
?

well
,
they
sure
were
nice
to
look
at
,
but
not
for
a
moment
did
one
of
them
scare
,
or
even
for
a
split-second
,
have
me
believ
that
they
were
anyth
more
than
hollywood
special
gadgetri
.

see
it
for
zeta-jon
,
or
if
you
like
special
effect
and
scari
movi
