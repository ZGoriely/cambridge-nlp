If
you
piss
a
``
famili
''
member
off
,
or
dishonor
yourself
in
ani
way
,
the
usual
punish
is
public
display
of
self-mutil
,
usual
result
in
the
loss
of

.

A
definit
of
dishonor
can
be
anyth
from
make
a
stupid
decis
to
leav
one
famili
for
anoth
.

It
would
be
interest
to
know
more
about
where
these
and
other
custom
come
from
.

unfortun
the
film
doe
n't

much

to
assum
they
would
be
symbol
of
someth
,
but
you
never
know
what
.

then
there
's
a
scene
in
which
a
man
kill
himself
in
front
of
a
rival
in
exchang
for
that
rival
join
the
famili
.

grant
,
thi
is
one
of
the
best
scene
in
the
movi
,
but
it
doe
n't
make
a
lot
of
sens
.

instead
,
the
two
hour
are
basic
spent
watch
the
follow
:
peopl
go
out
and
shoot
each
other
,
talk
about
it
for

minut
,
then
go
out
and
do

such

the

also
to

brother
tackl
the

A

is
easi

sure
peopl

they

It

just

back
