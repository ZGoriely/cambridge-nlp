So
ask
yourself
what
``
8mm
''
-lrb-
``
eight
millimet
''
-rrb-
is
realli
all
about
.

Is
it
about
a
wholesom
surveil
man
who
lose
sight
of
hi
valu
after
becom
enmesh
in
the
seedi
,
sleazi
underworld
of
hardcor
pornographi
?

Is
it
about
the
busi
itself
,
how
,
bubbl
just
beneath
the
surfac
of
big-town
americana
,
there
's
a
sordid
world
of
sick
and
deprav
peopl
who
wo
n't
necessarili
stop
short
of
murder
in
order
to
satisfi
their
sick
and
twist
desir
?

Or
is
it
about
those
who
can
,
those
who
are
in
a
posit
to
influenc
the
make
of
the
kind
of
film
sick
and
dement
peopl
want
to
see
?

I
'm
not
talk
about
snuff
film
,
suppos
``
documentari
''
of
victim
be
brutal
and
kill
on
camera
.

I
'm
talk
about
film
like
``
8mm
''
and
it
director
,
joel
schumach
.

with
a
recent
run
of
big
budget
movi

''
``
A

''
``

,
''
``
the
client
''
--
schumach
certainli
ha
that
kind
of
influenc
.

Is
``
8mm
''
someth
you
realli
want
to
see
?

probabl
not
.

the
first
two-third
of
``
8mm
''
unwind
as
a
fairli
convent
miss
person
drama
,
albeit
with
a
particularli
unsavori
core
.

then
,
as
it
's
been
threaten
all
along
,
the
film
explod
into
violenc
.

and
just
when
you
think
it
's
final
over
,
schumach
tag
on
a
ridicul
self-right
final
that
drag
the
whole
unpleas
experi
down
even
further
.

trust
me
.

there
are
better
way
to
wast
two
hour
of
your
life
