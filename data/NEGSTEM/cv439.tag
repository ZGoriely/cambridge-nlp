of
the
richest

florida

and

-rrb-
have
a
plot
to
extort
500k
from
the
old
man
:
harri
will
``
kidnap
''
odett
.

after
grope
both
women
,
harri
agre
.

As
everyon
except
harri
can
see
,
he
's
be
set
up
as
a
fall
guy
.

sure
enough
,
befor
long
,
harri
ha
a
dead
bodi
in
hi
trunk
and
the
cop
on
hi
tail
.

hi
brother-in-law
-lrb-
tom
wright
-rrb-
,
an
assist
DA
,
ha
hire
harri
to
be
the
press
liaison
for
the
case
,
so
harri
get
a
front
row
seat
for
hi
own
manhunt
-lrb-
and
we
get
to
watch
him
sweat-liter
-rrb-
.

there
are
sever
plot
twist
,
of
course-a
coupl
of
them
even
took
me
by
surpris
.

appar
everi
woman
in
palmetto
is
a
rave
horndog
,
and
they
're
on
harri
like
he
's
the
onli
bone
in
the
kennel
.

shue
vamp
so
broadli
that
I
expect
tex
averi
's
wolf
to
show
up
.

her
incred
perform
in
``
leav
la
vega
''
seem
to
have
been
a
fluke
.

here
,
she
could
easili
be
mistaken
for
melani
griffith
.

shue
's
charact
is
suppos
to
be
a
savvi
schemer
but
she
come
off
as
a
brainless
bimbo
.

In
addit
to
shue
and
sevigni
,
the
kennel
includ
gina
gershon
-lrb-
who
fill
the
dimwit-with-a-shady-past
role
in
``
bound
''
-rrb-
as
harri
's
girlfriend
nina
;
when
harri
get
out
of
jail
,
she
lick
hi
face
-lrb-
now
there
's
a
horndog
-rrb-
.

the
part
are
so
overplay
that
with
a
littl
push
``
palmetto
''
could
have
been
an
over-the-top
parodi
of
film
noir
a
la
``
romeo
is
bleed
.
''

As
it
is
,
it
's
best
watch
at
2am
on
showtim
-lrb-
the
love
scene
seem
to
have
been
written
for
one
of
that
channel
's
soft
porn
program
anyway
-rrb-
.

``
palmetto
''
ha
a
well-known
director
,
volker
schlndorff
,
who
's
best
known
for
hi
adapt
of
major
literari
work
,
especi
``
the
tin
drum
.
''

I
suppos
he
must
have
been
drawn
to
thi
plot-by-numb
script
by
the
same
admir
for
classic
film
noir
that
led
scorses
to
remak
``
cape
fear
.
''

schlndorff
tri
hard-h
make
an
interest
motif
out
of
the
ubiquit
palmetto
bugs-but
noth
can
freshen
up
thi
stale
script
.
