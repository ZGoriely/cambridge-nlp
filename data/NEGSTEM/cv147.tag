becaus
of
the
weak
charact
and
the
lack
of
screen
chemistri
between
them
,
the
film
flounder
with
all
the
appeal
of
a
dead
fish
until
the
box
match
actual
begin
.

but
even
then
,
becaus
the
outcom
is
so
predict
obviou
,
the
suspens
factor
is
negat
and
we
are
releg
to
just
watch
two
men
pummel
each
other
.

writer/director
ron
shelton
clearli
spent
much
time
orchestr
the
fight
sequenc
as
it
is
well
photograph
,
well-choreograph
,
well-edit
,
and
well-perform
.

If
onli
some
of
that
same
detail
attent
had
been
divert
to
the
remain
part
of
the
film
.

As
it
is
,
the
scene
which
requir
the
charact
to
actual
talk
to
one
anoth
are
weak
and
laughabl
.

the
titl
is
actual
the
most
interest
aspect
of
the
film
.

the
phrase
,
``
play
it
to
the
bone
'
is
a
refer
to
see
someth
all
the
way
through
or
not
quit
until
you
've
achiev
your
desir
goal
.
''

that
is
a
biblic
principl
.

``
know
ye
not
that
they
which
run
in
a
race
run
all
,
but
one
receiveth
the
prize
?
''

So
run
,
that
ye
may
obtain
.

We
need
to
develop
fulli
persuad
mindset
and
commit
level
in
order
to
endur
and
persever
past
the
obstacl
and
distract
which
lay
between
us
and
our
state
object
.

thi
is
true
in
practic
matter
of
our
physic
live
as
well
as
the
in
the
develop
matur
of
our
spiritu
live
.

As
a
movi
,
play
IT
TO
the
bone
is
hardli
worth
our
time
.

but
as
a
principl
of
life
,
the
phrase
``
play
it
to
the
bone
''
are
word
to
live
by
.
