befor
I
delv
into
the
meat
of
the
review
,
I
'd
just
like
to
confer
...
.

is
that
one
helluva
premis
,
or
what
?

`
final
destin
'
,
creepi
beyond
ration
comprehens
,
probabl
read
more
like
an
unsettl
`
x-file
'
episod
than
`
the
simpson
'
-
therefor
,
the
surpris
is
minim
when
you
discov
the
mutual
creator
behind
both
are
glen
morgan
and
jame
wong
.

On
familiar
turf
,
the
task
of
establish
foot
is
not
difficult
for
morgan
and
wong
,
and
the
openingminut
of
`
final
destin
'
reflect
that
.

unlik
most
thriller
,
the
set-up
is
crisp
and
cool
.

you
just
deepli
,
sincer
hope
that
the
momentum
wo
n't
unspool
,
leav
us
with
a
second-str
effort
with
noth
but
cheap
,
deriv
shock
.

young
viewer
have
a
palpabl
reason
to
expect
thi
kind
of
formula
deterior
,
what
with
`
I
know
what
you

'
and
--
a
movi
with
a
nifti
premis
that
just
plung
like
an

--
`

'
.

after
the
set-up
,
when
I
remain
slouch
apprehens
in
my
chair
,
I
start
to
realli
have
fun
with
`

.

low

behold
,
a

that
is
actual

some
splotti

,
thi
film
is
among
the
most
refresh
and
all-out
enjoy
horror

a
exhilar

against
all
the
blood-spatt

not

and
you
have
what
could
be
anoth
gener
teenag
frightfest
with

and
assort
disembowel
.

not
so
.

`
final
destin
'
ha
no
slice
and
dice
,
or
at
least
none
dealt
by
a
human
killer
,
and
the
thought
of
death
itself
as
the
unseen
stalker
is
uniqu
and
frighten
.

the
extra
dimens
of
disconcert
ironi
rejuven
the
decay
murderer-on-the-loos
'
concept
,
with
assist
from
a
shrewd
,
intellig
pace
screenplay
by
morgan
,
wong
and
jeffrey
reddick
.

the
plot
twist
are
fun
and
clever
without
toppl
into
utter
absurd
-lrb-
listen
up
,
`
reindeer
game
'
-rrb-
.

but
I
suppos
the
most
satisfi
aspect
of
`
final
destin
'
is
the
murder
scene
.

creativ
,
resourc
and
breathlessli
invent
,
the
death
sequenc
involv
an
unlik
string
of
event
lead
to
a
charact
's
demis
.

what
will
trigger
the
accid
?

will
it
be
the
john
denver
record
,
just
put
on
to
play
`
rocki
mountain
high
'
?

-lrb-
yeah
,
sick
humor
-rrb-
.

will
it
be
the
leak
toilet
?

the
fall
fish
reel
in
the
corner
?

the
murder
are
startl
and
larg
unforeseen
,
includ
one
surpris
incid
that
made
the
audienc
jump
out
of
their
seat
and
giggl
nervous
for
roughli
a
minut
afterward
.

A
sens
of
giddi
unpredict
is
ad
with
thi
invent
approach
.

It
get
sorta
tasteless
and
cheap
sometim
,
but
who
care
?

It
's
fun
.

In
that
simpl
regard
,
`
final
destin
'
is
my
cup
of
tea
.

thi
stylishli
execut
thriller
,
although
tag
with
laughabl
circumst
and
the
occasion
snippet
of
lame
dialogu
,
is
an
immens
entertain
jaunt
to
the
dark
side
.

after
the
show
,
it
will
also
have
an
frighten
impact
on
you
.

when
will
your
design
'
expir
?

Is
death
wait
around
the
corner
?

the
`
final
'
effect
is
a
major
case
of
the
heebie-jeebi
.
