the
word
`
rest
'
in
the
titl
should
be
stress
sinc
thi
is
a
movi
that
lack
ani
action
scene
at
all
.

what
doe
take
place
is
more
base
on
charact
develop
.

the
film
start
right
in
the
middl
of
the
live
of
four
peopl
:
nick
,
beth
,
carol
and
sid
.

what
they
have
done
earlier
is
for
the
most
part

.

nick
and
beth
have
a
relationship
and
have
decid
to
move
from
enfield

arizona
to
butt

montana

-rrb-
carol
is
nick
's
ex-girlfriend
and
beth
's
best
friend
,
sid
is
a
joint-smok
painter
that
come
to
repaint
their
hous
befor
the
new
tenant
move
in
.

obvious
base
on
a
stage
play
,
the
problem
with
the
movi
is
that
there
's
a
lot
of
thing
left
out
.

It
's
not
obviou
that
nick
and
beth
are
in
love
with
each
other
,
the
reason
whi
nick
wa
