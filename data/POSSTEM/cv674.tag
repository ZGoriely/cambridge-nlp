look
back
at
all
the
time
in
your
life
when
there
wa
a
fork
in
the
path
to
the
futur

some
sort
of
decis
had
to
be
made

about
the

and
how
thing
might
have
turn
out
if
the
choic
had
been
differ
.

perhap
even
more
dizzi
to
contempl
is
how
a
seemingli
minor
action
--
catch
the
10

train
,
for

--
could
have
an
equal
profound

that
's
whi
there
's
no
shortag
of
movi
about
thi
subject
.

the
best
of
the
bunch
were
probabl
made
by
the
late
polish
director
krzysztof
kieslowski
,
who
wa
obsess
with
question
of
fate
and
chanc
.

these

the

and
the

,
they
are

examin
in
