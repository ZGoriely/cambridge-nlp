all
while
talk
to
her
brother
.

As
much
as
anyth
,
the
film
is
a
seri
of
charact
sketch
.

In
one
of
the
strongest
we
watch
william
in
a
flashback
as
he
ha
hi
first
sexual
encount
,
a
homosexu
one

he
is

with

finess
the

craft
a

take

and
gentli
introduc

to
the
joy
of

with
the
opposit

all
of
thi
notwithstand
,
he
still
prefer
male
.

the
film
is
at
it
most
poignant
in
sever
sequenc
in
which
the
grown
william
come
face-to-fac
with
himself
when
younger
.

thi
caus

wa
so
overwhelm
with
the
stress

even
here
,
the
director
touch
your
heart
without
ever
let
the
stori
dissolv
into
anyth
approach
a
tearjerk
.

the
ultim
result
is
an
uplift

hope
that
