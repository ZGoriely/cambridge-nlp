I
relish
those
rare
opportun
when
a
talent
screenwrit
can
make
me
feel
like
a
fool
.

I
spent
the
first
hour
of
forc

slowli

over
it
grim
attitud
toward

grous
to
myself
about

,
and
wait
for
the
inevit

thi
wa
a
mass

romant
comedi
,
after
all
,
a
genr
which
ha
been
taken
over
by
teenag
and
,
even
in
it
best
day
,
work
hard
to
perpetu
the
romanc

paradigm
.

then
marc

did
someth
wonder
,
someth
which
made
the

click
into

:
he
show
me
a
comic
love

about

over

ben
love
hi

bridget
-lrb-
maura

-rrb-
,
but
the
doom-and-gloom
pronounc
of
everyon
around
him
have
him
question
the
mean
of
thi
'till

do
you

then
,
on
an
ill-fat
flight
from
new
york
to
hi

in

,
ben
meet
sarah
lewi
-lrb-
sandra
bullock
-rrb-
,
a
free-spirit
woman
with
a
string
of
fail
career
and
relationship
behind
her

As

them
at

,
ben
and
sarah
begin
a
three-day
southward
journey
in
which
their

grow
ever
stronger
,
ben
see
in
sarah
the
chanc
he
's
never
taken
and
sarah
see
in

the
stabil
she
's
never

forc

off
to
a
solid
enough
start
,
set
up
the
charact
and
the
situat
with
plenti

witti

ben
is
an
ideal
role
for
affleck
's
easy-go
charm
,
and
he
play
the
straight-lac

man
without

sandra

,
for

,
is
more
