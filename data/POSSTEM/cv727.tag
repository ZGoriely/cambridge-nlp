shock
,
move
end
of

it
is
.

the
classic
theme
music

``
midnight
cowboy
''
help
bring
about
the
feel
of
attach
that
most
viewer
will
experi
toward
the
end
of
the
film
.

whether
the
attach
is
to
the
two
main
charact
or
to
their
dream
,
is
probabl
as
debat
as
whether
it
wa
the
act
or
the
direct
that
make
thi
film
so
memor
.
