the
stori

As
wa
the
case
with
_
ghost
in
the
shell
_
,
if
you
just
want
a
no-brain
actionfest
,
thi
might
not
be
the
movi
for
you
.

_
patlabor
:
the
movi
_
is
more
of
a
psycholog
thriller
,
a
technolog
suspens
drama
.

It
is
closer
,
perhap
,
to
a
chrichton
novel
than
to
an
action
movi
-lrb-
crichton
novel
that
have
been
made
_
into
_
action
movi
notwithstand
-rrb-
.

there
are
long
,
thought
montag
of
dialogueless
footag
as
two
investig
make
their
way
through
slum
and
derelict
hous
in
old
quarter
of
tokyo
,
similar
to
sequenc
from
_
ghost
in
the
shell
_
.

thi
movi
is
fraught
with
symbol
--
in
fact
a
larg
part
of
it
is
base
on
christian
symbol
.

patlabor
's
near-futur
set
is
,
asid
from
the
giant
robot
tromp
around
,
veri
similar
to
our
own
present
day
.

the
film
use
thi
set
to
make
it
central
point
:
is
progress
move
too
fast
for
human
to
keep
up
?

are
histori
and
cultur
fall
by
the
waysid
like
the
old
build
that
are
be
torn
down
and
replac
with
new
?

thi
is
a
question
just
as
applic
to
today
as
it
is
to
patlabor
's
alternate-1999
set
.

As
far
as
the
technic
aspect
of
the
film
go
-lrb-
refer
to
the
subtitl
version
,
as
that
's
the
onli
one
I
've
seen
-rrb-
,
the
film
transfer
is
clear
,
almost
phenomen
so
.

the
anim
qualiti
is
incred
,
though
the
charact
design
is
differ
from
what
most
patlabor
fan
will
be
use
to
.

the
oav
and
TV
seri
were
more
cheer
,
better-suit
to
humor
;
the
movi
,
howev
,
make
everyon
look
a
great
deal
less
cute
,
and
emphas
that
thi
is
go
to
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
a
deadli
seriou
storylin
.

As
far
as
cinematographi
goe
,
there
are
mani
interest
moment
in
_
patlabor
:
the
movi
_
.

I
do
n't
think
I
can
recal
ever
see
a
fish-ey
perspect
use
in
ani
other
anim
film
-lrb-
save
for
_
ghost
in
the
shell
_
,
anoth
oshii
film
-rrb-
,
or
inde
,
in
mani
other
movi
at
all
.

the
cinematographi
is
well-suit
to
the
storylin
,
emphas
what
it
need
to
,
though
a
coupl
of
scene
-lrb-
where
charact
'
featur
are
exagger
in
anger
-rrb-
may
seem
slightli
strang
to
western
audienc
.

the
audio
track
of
_
patlabor
:
the
movi
_
is
in
gloriou
hi-fi
stereo
,
and
should
be
use
to
demonstr
home
theater
system
--
it
_
is
_
that
good
.

even
without
headphon
,
sound
from
either
side
of
the
screen
can
be
clearli
heard
to
_
come
_
from
that
side
.

giant
robot
footstep
are
deep
and
boom
.

the
sometimes-underst
,
sometimes-blar
score
is
crisp
and
clear
,
and
alway
right
on
the
mark
,
enhanc
the
mood
creat
by
the
anim
sceneri
.

As
far
as
the
subtitl
go
,
I
have
to
say
that
they
're
among
the
most
easily-read
subtitl
I
've
ever
seen
for
_
anyth
_
.

larg
enough
that
they
do
n't
strain
the
eye
,
but
small
enough
not
to
conceal
too
much
of
the
screen
.

although
it
doe
have
sever
action
sequenc
in
it
,
most
notabl
the
climact
conclus
,
_
patlabor
_
is
foremost
not
an
action
movi
.

although
it
is
a
superbly-r
film
,
it
reli
in
larg
part
upon
prior
familiar
with
some
of
the
charact
to
carri
the
stori
,
and
that
could
detract
from
some
peopl
's
enjoy
.
