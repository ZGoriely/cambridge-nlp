with
three
movi
alreadi
-lrb-
re
-rrb-
releas
theatric
in
america
,
and
at
least
three
more
on
their
way
,
jacki
chan
is
one
of
the
newest
``
hot
properti
''
in
action
adventur
stardom
,
and
it
's
just
about
time
.

for
over
twenty-f
year
,
jacki
's
been
star
in
martial
art
and
action
movi
in
hong
kong
,
thrill
audienc
with
both
an
incred
grasp
of
acrobat
and
martial
art
and
a
wonder
sens
of
comedi
.

``
drunken
master
''
ha
the
distinct
of
be
the
first
jacki
chan
movi
to
``
make
it
big
''
--
thi
is
the
movi
that
supposedli
set
jacki
up
for
big
stardom
in
hong
kong
.

I
'm
not
entir
sure
whi
,
exactli
.

In
mani
way
,
``
drunken
master
''
is
similar
to
most
of
jacki
's
other
earli
film
,
such
as
``
fearless
hyena
''
I
and
II
,
``
master
with
crack
finger
''
,
``
half
a
loaf
of
kung
Fu
''
,
``
spiritu
kung
Fu
''
,
and
other
.

In
fact
,
look
at
all
these
earli
film
togeth
,
one
get
the
impress
that
they
were
stamp
out
,
cookie-cutt
style
,
at
a
rate
of
four
to
six
per
year
,
all
use
the
same
cast
and
tell
veri
similar
stori
.

To
be
honest
,
I
think
that
earli
jacki
chan
movi
are
someth
of
an
acquir
tast
.

they
're
quit
differ
from
action
movi
as
we
know
them
in
america
.

these
film
tend
to
be
set
in
the
chines
countrysid
in
an
indetermin
period
sometim
in
the
distant
past
,
with
fairli
slow
plot
that
often
meander
far
afield
and
sometim
seem
to
exist
onli
for
the
intent
of
string
comedi
and
fight
scene
togeth
.

``
drunken
master
''
,
though
it
plot
is
tighter
than
some
,
is
no
except
.

-lrb-
As
an
asid
,
``
drunken
master
''
wa
the
first
jacki
chan
movi
I
ever
saw
,
and
I
saw
it
the
way
it
wa
meant
to
be
seen
...
in
a
movi
theater
in
seattl
,
as
part
of
an
asian
film
festiv
.

At
the
time
,
I
did
n't
realli
think
it
wa
anyth
special
...
but
after
have
seen
more
film
like
it
,
it
's
kind
of
grown
on
me
.

``

,
and
ha
a
big

with
an

``

featur
some
wonder
martial
art
sequenc
,
with
jacki
win
some
fight
and
lose
other
.

It
's
been
said
befor
,
but
I
'll
say
it
again
--
these
fight
do
n't
just
_
happen
_
,
they
're
as
care
choreograph
as
ani
ballet
perform
,
and
it
show
.

In
hi
fight
,
jacki
often
make
use
of
object
found
in
hi
environ
--
bench
,
jug
,
cup
,
bowl
,
fruit
and
veget
--
often
in
new
and
surpris
way
.

the
fight
scene
,
particularli
those
toward
the
end
of
the
film
,
are
unparallel
in
most
american
film
.

whether
jacki
win
or
lose
,
it
's
realli
someth
to
see
...
and
it
's
often
as
funni
as
anyth
,
too
.

and
funni
is
the
other
thing
jacki
chan
is
veri
,
veri
good
at
.

there
's
veri
littl
that
's
new
in
thi
movi
--
jacki
win
fight
,
jacki
get
beaten
badli
by
a
master
,
jacki
go
through
punish
or
train
...
these
schtick
have
all
been
seen
befor
,
in
ani
one
of
sever
dozen
similar
jacki
movi
from
the
seventi
and
earli
eighti
.

but
they
're
still
hilari
as
ever
.

likewis
,
jacki
ha
a
_
great
_
support
cast
,
mani
of
whom
were
also
in
other
earli
jacki
film
,
and
they
're
often
the
sourc
of
plenti
of
hilar
on
their
own
.

the
realli
big
thing
about
``
drunken
master
''
,
though
,
that
inspir
sever
copycat
-lrb-
includ
a
coupl
star
jacki
himself
-rrb-
and
a
sequel
fifteen
year
later
,
wa
the
drunken-styl
kung
Fu
.

I
'm
not
certain
whether
or
not
thi
is
actual
a
genuin
style
of
kung
Fu
,
but
the
principl
behind
it
is
to
imit
the
wobbl
movement
of
a
drunkard
to
lull
the
enemi
into
a
fals
sens
of
secur
...
and
it
appar
help
if
you
're
drunk
while
you
're
do
it
.

genuin
or
not
,
I
have
to
admit
,
there
's
just
someth
incred
fun
about
watch
a
fellow
who
look
utterli
slosh
wade
into
a
group
of
startl
oppon
and
make
mincemeat
out
of
them
befor
they
even
realiz
what
's
go
on
.

come
to
think
of
it
,
perhap
thi
element
is
what
account
for
thi
film
's
success
over
ani
of
the
other
jacki
film
...
it
's
not
just
martial
art
,
it
's
the
kind
of
martial
art
that
make
you
stop
and
go
,
``
whoa
...
''
On
the
neg
side
,
the
cinematographi
in
thi
film
is
noth
special
,
the
film
stock
is
rather
primit
,
the
plot
is
often
rather
slow
,
and
the
subtitl
are
sometim
extrem
hard
to
read
against
the
background
.

``
gone
with
the
wind
''
,
thi
is
n't
.

still
,
if
you
like
martial
art
film
,
or
like
what
you
've
seen
so
far
of
jacki
chan
and
want
to
see
more
,
give
it
a
shot
.

It
's
much
more
``
real
''
than
chuck
norri
or
jean-claud
van
damm
.

you
might
veri
well
like
it
.

anoth
interest
thing
about
``
drunken

''
ha
to
do
with

``

there
are
plenti
of

these
are
typic
either
in

pan-and-scan
form
or
els

at

if
noth

,
you
can
enjoy
the

I
particularli
recommend
``

``

,
the

also
,
for
a
rather
differ
interpret
of
the
charact
wong
fei-hong
-lrb-
who
is
in

a

figur
from

If
