martin
's
decis
to
tell
the
stori
from
a
bottom
feeder
's
point
of
view
is
what
keep
it
fresh
and
innovative-nev
have
we
seen
on
screen
a
group
of
peopl
struggl
thi
hard
to
complet
a
motion
pictur
.

As
expect
,
there
are
laugh
onli
to
be
had
insid
or
buff
,
such
as
martin
's
crew
of
mexican
border-jump
,
who
gain
unexpect
appreci
for
the
classic
from
read
``
cahier
Du
cinema
,
''
or
martin
's
nonsens
explan
to
dave
,
hi
loyal
cinematograph
-lrb-
jami
kennedi
-rrb-
,
that
everi
movi
,
in
the
end
,
ha
a
budget
of
two-thousand
dollar
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
.

most
of
bowfing
is
univers
funni
,
howev
;
I
defi
ani
viewer
to
keep
a
straight
face
when
christin
baranski
,
one
of
our
brightest
comedienn
,
is
on
screen
.

bowfing
's
main
flaw
is
a
plot
twist
that
ha
an
insubstanti
aftermath
.

We
're
also
ask
to
believ
that
a
few
simpl
close-up
of
kit
ramsey
would
redeem
``
chubbi
rain
,
''
z-grade
entertain
that
would
make
Ed
wood
blush
.

-lrb-
thi
aspect
of
bowfing
ha
much
in
common
with
the
ludicr
oscar
sequenc
in
Oz
's
last
directori
effort
,
the
poorli
conceiv
In
&
out
.
-rrb-

these
are
signific
enough
weak
that
they
distract
from
my
enjoy
of
the
piec
.

As
I
mention
at
the
start
of
thi
review
,
bowfing
offer
solid
reason
not
to
do
what
heather
graham
's
charact
daisi
doe
:
hop
a
bu
to
hollywood
in
search
of
stardom
.

that
said
,
it
offer
one
fantast
reason
to
get
on
that
bu
:
the
sens
of
commun
between
filmmak
who
gel
is
awesom
.

martin
get
sentiment
by
stori
's
end
as
he
did
in
l.a.
stori
,
and
how
could
he
not
?

for
those
who
can
hack
it
,
the
movi
might
be
the
greatest
busi
in
the
world
.
