okay
,
let
me
first
say
,
thi
is
a
beavi
and
butthead
movi
.

If
you
do
not
like
beavi
and
butthead
,
DO
not
go
to
see
thi
movi
!!!!!
howev
,
if
you
do
like
them
,
I
recommen
you
get
out
right
now
and
go
see
it
.

the
movi
start
off
with
the
boy
wonder
what
happen
to
their
TV
.

they
notic
that
it
ha
been
stolen
and
they
vow
to
find
it
.

thi
wind
their
way
through
america
search
for
dalla
-lrb-
she
is
a
woman
-rrb-
.

they
look
for
her
becaus
as
they
are
search
for
the
TV
,
they
find
a
drunk
who
want
them
``
to
do
''
hi
wife
.

well
,
of
cours
they
think
he
want
them
to
score
with
her
when
actual
he
want
them
to
kill
her
.

and
the
fun
start
their
.

thi
movi
is
a
mix
of
funni
gag
that
anli
beavi
and
butthead
could
pull
off
.

It
is
qualiti
entertain
that
onli
fan
of
beavi
and
butthead
would
enjoy
.

I
enjoy
thi
movi
alot
becaus
mike
judg
knew
how
to
keep
pace
.

even
when
they
were
crawl
through
the
desert
and
I
thought
the
movi
start
to
lag
,
he
manag
to
keep
the
laugh
come
.

If
you
expect
chang
from
the
show
keep
look
.

the
same
charact
,
the
same
voic
,
the
same
everyth
from
the
show
and
that
's
what
make
it
good
.

you
might
think
with
a
movi
from
a
TV
show
,
you
can
chang
a
few
thing
.

often
time
thi
spell
disast
for
film
becaus
the
film
maker
veer
away
from
what
made
the
show
popular
in
the
first
place
!
