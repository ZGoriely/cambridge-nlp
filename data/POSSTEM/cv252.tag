soon
it
becom
clear
that
colqhoun
's
tale
ha
ramif
beyond
cannib
and
the
will
to
surviv
.

It
involv
an
old
indian
myth
call
weendigo
,
which
state
that
a
man
who
eat
the
flesh
of
anoth
steal
that
person
's
strength
,
spirit

veri

hi

the
more

,
and
the
stronger
he
becom
.

there
can
never
be
enough
,
and
death
is
the
onli
escap
.
.

It
's
all
fairli
sicken
and
you
have
to
have
a
healthi
stomach
to
see
the
whole
movi
through
.

As
profession
made
as
the
movi
is
,
you
have
to
wonder
who
they
thought
would
come
pile
into
the
theater
to
see
thi
.

teen-ag
horror
fan
wo
n't
care
becaus
none
of
the
soldier
look
remot
like
neve
campel
.

older
folk
might
show
up
when
they
hear
that
the
movi
is
actual
a
satir
about
the
pioneer
spirit
,
but
they
'll
be
disappoint
onc
all
the
raw
meat
start
get
wave
in
their
face
.

but
joke
asid
,
thi
is
a
film
that
is
well
worth
watch
.

It
ha
wonder
and
matur
charact
,
that
few
horror
film
s
can
boast
of
and
a
strang
effect
stori
that
continu
to
electrifi
you
till
the
end
.

the
two
main
charact
are
also
the
most
interest
.

boyd
is
a
simpl
,
honest
man
tier
of
war
,
kill
and
fear
.

hi
sacr
wish
is
to
live
a
normal
,
quit
life
away
from
gunpowd
and
blood
.

colqhoun
is
differ
.

He
prove
that
a
man
,
on
the
brink
of
death
,
would
do
anyth
to
stay
aliv
,
includ
sacrif
hi
own
soul
.

He
believ
so
much
in
thi
indian
myth
that
he
start
to
chang
physic
.

It
is
the
power
of
the
human
mind
and
convict
that
make
miracl
happen
.

the
atmospher
in
``
raven
''
is
macabr
and
bizarr
,
scari
and
surreal
.

complet
isol
from
the
rest
of
the
world
,
stand
fort
spencer
.

here
time
stand
still
,
and
noth
chang
.

the
inhabit
are
soldier
driven
by
war
and
pillag
.

they
are
all
somehow
loser
of
societi
that
have
been
banish
--
men
that
are
use
to
kill
and
have
not
done
anyth
els
in
their
entir
life
.

men
that
are
noth
,
and
ha
noth
to
loos
.

the
result
is
some
sort
of
cabin
fever
.

cannib
is
more
like
a
sick
game
for
them
.

sinc
they
find
no
pleasur
in
live
,
they
find
some
excit
in
kill
and
die
.

It
's
like
``
who
's
go
to
die
first
?
''

the
unchang
ici
landscap
,
where
bird
do
not
sing
and
even
wind
doe
n't
move
the
leav
on
the
tree
,
resembl
kubrick
's
``
the
shine
''
.

It
's
hard
to
not
get
mad
here
!

one
of
the
scari
aspect
of
the
film
is
a
strang
connect
that
the
viewer
establish
with
the
charact
,
and
start
to
understand
them
,
although
they
have
turn
into
half
craze
killer
.

music
is
anoth
factor
that
strengthen
the
atmospher
.

A
strang
music
score
,
compos
by
michael
nyman
-lrb-
the
piano
-rrb-
and
damon
albarn
,
that
often
seem
out
of
place
,
and
in
complet
contrast
to
the
imag
,
somehow
reflect
the
charact
'
twist
reaction
on
the
world
and
their
situat
.

the
director
herself
state
that
it
wa
``
OK
to
laugh
''
dure
the
pictur
.

and
I
must
admit
that
it
is
often
veri
funni
,
in
a
strang
way
-lrb-
such
as
the
wonder
quot
:
''
.
.

It
's
lone
be
a
cannib
.
''

you
do
n't
get
that
mani
friend
...
``
or
when
colqhoun
is
quot
ben
franklin
,
say
''
eat
to
live
.

Do
n't
live
to
eat
.
''
-rrb-
.

but
mostli
it
is
frighten
and
shock
as
it
goe
deeper
into
the
mind
of
these
strang
men
and
we
wit
their
psycholog
chang
.
''

everi
actor
doe
a
great
job
.

especi
robert
carlyl
as
the
sinist
and
intellig
cannib
,
and
guy
pearc
as
the
moral
and
honest
soldier
,
nag
by
hi
undeserv
honor
.

thi
strang
coupl
resembl
lestat
and
loi
in
neil
jordan
's
'
interview
with
the
vampir
'
.

actual
there
are
mani
amus
parallel
and
connect
to
vampir
movi
,
sinc
the
topic
are
so
alik
.

``
raven
''
start
wonder
and
continu
to
shock
and
scare
until
it
get
to
the
final
,
where
it
loos
focu
and
get
too
primit
and
rather
bore
.

howev
these
littl
failur
do
n't
diminish
the
impress
.

thi
is
a
bizarr
dark
comedi
about
the
human
mind
and
it
chang
in
differ
situat
.

It
is
a
scari
fabl
about
the
monster
that
lurk
in
everyon
's
soul
,
a
dark
side
which
we
're
all
tri
to
hide
--
but
it
's
there
--
alway

It
is
one
of
the
most
frighten
and
success
