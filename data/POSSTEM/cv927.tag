In

but
it
lack

I
talk
to
a
tibetan
I
met
outsid
the
theater
who
had
just
seen
the
film
and
wa
walk
back
in
to
see
it
again
.

hear
hi
descript
of
how
he
escap
from

at
the
age
of
seven
and
how
hi
father
wa
one

I
wa
struck
by
what
wa
miss
in
the
movi

As
grand
as
it
look
and
as
histor
accur
as
it
is
,
there
is
a
distanc
between
the
audienc
and
the
movi
.

the
film
is
more
concern
with
visual
and
histori
and
less
so
with
human
be
.

with
the
except
of
a
few
scene
,
involv
with
the
charact
is
slight
.

one
of
those
except
is
the
portray
of
the
young
dalai
lama
,
shown
as
a
mischiev
boy
who
ca
n't
resist
be
a
kid
sometim
.

encount
with

older

who
tell
the
young
leader
the
chines
have
order
him
to
persuad
him
to
accept
communist
rule
or
kill
him
is
an
outstand
moment
,
but
there
are
n't
mani
of
these
.

even
with
it
problem
,
the
``
kundun
''
experi
is
phenomen
,
but
one
that
I
fear
most
will
miss
.

mani
peopl
who
saw
``
seven
year
In
tibet
''
will
have
a
``
been
there
,
done
that
''
attitud
.

It
's
like
that
the
film
will
miss
a
wide-spread
appeal
and
public
respons
will
be
the
sound
of
one
hand
clap
