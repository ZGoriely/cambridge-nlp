By
then
,
henri

.

also
there
are
cameo

kenneth
connor
and
peter
butterworth
,
who
play
barbara
's
father
.

the
set
and
costum
design
is
first
class
and
the
overal
product
of
thi
film
is
good
.

there
is
even
an
earli
appear
from
david
prows
,
who
later
becam
the
green
cross
code
man
and
darth
vader
.

the
film
doe
have
it
's
downsid
though
,
as
it
is
get
pretti
routin
for
the
carry-on
team
to
stage
histor
film
and
the
invent
streak
of
the
script
seem
to
run
out
pretti
quickli
.

there
is
also
the
absenc
of
hatti
jacqu
and
bernard
bresslaw
,
who
could
have

the
film
along
.

howev
,
overal
the
film
is
funni
and
there
are
plenti
of
laugh
and
sauci
joke
,
so
that
is
whi
I
mainli
recommend
it
to
carri
on
fan
onli
,
but
there
is
enough
humour
in
the
film
to
make
it
worth
anyon
's
while
to
sit
down
and
watch
it
.
