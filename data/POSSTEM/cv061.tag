the

instead

to
save
han
solo
-lrb-
harrison
ford
-rrb-
from
the
clutch
of
the
intergalact
gangster
jabba
the
hutt
.

It
is
at
jabba
's
home
,
a
creepy-look
stone
fortress
guard
by
hog-nos
beast
,
that
most
of
the
ad
special
effect
come
into
play
.

from
a
hyster
scene
involv
a
music
group
to
the
dread
beast
outsid
jabba
's
sand
barg
,
the
effect
are
top
notch
.

As
soon
as
han
is
freed
from
hi
cryo-freez
and
rescu
from
the
clutch
of
the
evil
jabba
the
hutt
,
it
's
back
to
outer
space
,
where
the
rebel
allianc
is
about
to
face
the
empir
's
newest
threat
:
a
second
,
more
power
death
star
,
that
,
if
activ
,
could
spell
doom
for
anyon
who
stand
against
the
emperor
.

So
,
while
the
fleet
prepar
for
the
final
battl
,
luke
and
compani
travel
to
the
forest
moon
of
endor
to
knock
out
the
shield
that
defend
the
death
star
against
all
attack
.

there
,
they
are
befriend
by
the
ewok
,
the
teddi
bear-lik
nativ
race
,
and
luke
,
fear
that
hi
presenc
is
endang
the
group
,
turn
himself
over
to
vader
.

return
of
the
jedi
ha
some
interest
element
.

the
scene
which
pit
luke
against
the
emperor
and
vader
are
suitabl
tens
and
well-act
.

from
a
technic
point-of-view
,
the
space
battl
are
amaz
,
easili
hinder
anyth
depict
in
the
previou
film
.

not
onli
are
there
mani
,
mani
more
ship
,
but
their
speed
and
rang
of
movement
have
been
dramat
improv
.

On
one
level
,
return
of
the
jedi
is
almost
worth
watch
for
the
special
effect
.

In
the
special
edit
,
even
more
ship
are
ad
,
make
the
final
space
battl
incred
fun
to
watch
.

the
act
in
return
of
the
jedi
is
stronger
than
in
the
previou
film
.

By
now
-lrb-
or
then-1983
-rrb-
,
mark
hamil
,
harrison
ford
,
and
carri
fisher
have
all
matur
in
their
on-screen
persona
.

the
chemistri
amongst
the
trio
is
terrif
.

As
in
empir
,
billi
dee

give
us
anoth
human
hero
to
root
for
.

newcom
ian

and
evil
creatur
,
although
he
's
not
as
impos
as

.

although
it
wa
great
fun
watch
star

and
the
empir
strike
back
on
the
big
screen
,
return
of
the
jedi

a
greater
sens
of
enjoy
.

with
the
spectacular
,
new
special
effect
,
the
ador

,
the
sinist

,
the
evil

,
the
destruct
of
the

,
and
the
alway
lovabl

,
return
of
the

conclud
one
of
the
greatest
trilog
ever
made
with
a
huge
