throw
in
perhap
too
healthi
a
dosag
of
sherlock
holm
,
but
the
visual
treatment
of
the
film
is
absolut
entranc
,
as
burton
offer
foggi
local
and
detail
costum
that
are
gorgeou
and
stir
to
examin
.

As
`
sleepi
hollow
'
open
,
we
're
greet
with
a
juici
cameo
from
martin
landau
,
who
won
an
oscar
in
burton
's
`
Ed

.

landau

who
,
on
a

is

landlord

explain
to
crane
that
the
head
have
been
sever
from
the
carcass
and
mysteri
taken
in
each
separ
case
,
and
that
they
believ
the
murder
is
a
dead

trooper
-lrb-
play
briefli
by
a
wonder
jar
christoph
walken
-rrb-
who
ha
risen
from
the
grave
after
be
decapit
in
the
western
wood
.

crane
is
not
a
man
of
great
superstit
,
and
is
determin
to
root
out
the
human
culprit
with
hi
assort
of
gizmo
and
gadget
-lrb-
thing
I
wa
not
surpris
to
find
in
a
tim
burton
movi
-rrb-
.

first
and
foremost
,
`
sleepi
hollow
'
is
a
fun
horror
film
.

As
with
virtual
all
burton
movi
,
we
are
treat
to
a
wonder
score
by
compos
danni
elfman
,
who
ha
onc
again
pour
excit
and
imagin
into
an
atmospher
soundtrack
that
accentu
the
gothic
mood
perfectli
.

the
horseman
f/x
are
stylish
and
impress
,
particularli
in
perfectli
blend
battl
sequenc
involv
actual
actor
.

but
whi
did
I
enjoy
`
sleepi
hollow
'
as
much
as
I
did
?

although
enjoy
,
it
wa
not
the
numer
behead
and
the
plenti
gore
that
spurt
left
and
right
.
.

It
wa
the
light
comic
touch
that
burton
appli
.

the
film
ha
the
sweet
of
a
candi
appl
,
usual
channel
through
depp
's
wonder
perform
as
the
lovabl
geek
ichabod
crane
,
who
is
no
longer
a
mild-mann
school
teacher
but
still
attain
hi
cowardli
qualiti
.

thi
is
certainli
not
the
onli
alter
that
's
been
made
.

As
the
film
progress
,
it
becom
appar
that
walker
is
more
concern
with
the
mysteri
of
the
murder
than
the
murder
themselv
.

the
momentum
is
slow
consider
onc
crane
begin
piec
the
mysteri
togeth
,
becaus
for
the
audienc
,
it
's
not
an
issu
we
particularli
wish
to
be
solv
.

It
's
more
effect
for
the
headless
horseman
to
be
an
elus
demon
than
an
elus
demon
with
an
ulterior
motiv
.

still
,
we
are
still
captiv
by
the
breathtak
technic
detail
and
burton
's
keen
eye
to
captur
our
attent
.

the
costum
is
except
,
and
the
dialogu
is
crisp
and
effect
throughout
-lrb-
it
's
recogniz
that
the
script
wa
refin
by
award-win
playwright
tom
stoppard
-rrb-
.

the
support
cast
exhibit
more
color
and
play
than
mani
.

A
blond
christina
ricci
is
in
fine
form
as
von
tassel
's
daughter
katrina
,
and
an
unlik
romanc
between
she
and
ichabod
is
surprisingli
consist
.

walken
,
michael
gough
-lrb-
who
appear
in
burton
's
`
batman
'
film
-rrb-
and
miranda
richardson
are
all
enjoy
in
tackl
their
separ
role
.

I
suppos
the
strength
behind
`
sleepi
hollow
'
lie
within
the
central
trio
:
director
burton
,
constabl
depp
and
the
headless
horseman
who
hunt
him
down
with
ruthless
accuraci
.

all
of
thi
is
not
to
be
taken
serious
,
of
cours
.

`
sleepi
hollow
'
is
a
lavish
,
frighten
and
altogeth
amus
rework
of
a
classic
tale
that
mani
peopl
cherish
as
children
.

If
you
've
got
a
decent
head
on
your
shoulder
,
you
'll
have
the
good
sens
to
gallop
off
to
the
theater
and
enjoy
it
one
last
time
.
