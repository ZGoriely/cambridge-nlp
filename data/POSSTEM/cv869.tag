ultim
,
what
is
so
good
about
``

is
that
,
within
the
confin
of
the
slasher
genr
,
writer-director

glen
morgan

jeffrey

have
creat
a
premis
that
ha
never
been

thi
manner

and
a
film
that
ha
the
abil
to
both
surpris

frighten
--
two
thing
that
are
rare
found
in

If
anyth

it
's
safe
to
say
you
will
never
ever
look
