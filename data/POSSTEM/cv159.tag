is
in
the
process
of
work
on
the
script
for

.

even
the
film
's
content
is
a
bit
reminisc
of
mile
.

In
fact
,
it
's
the
perfect
blend
of
the
feel-good
'
60
nostalgia
of
stand

-lrb-
also
by

,
joe
gould
's
secret
-rrb-
,
who
seem
to
care
more
about
her

when

the
fatherless
bobbi
find
a
male
role
model
in
ted
brautigan
-lrb-
anthoni
hopkin
,
hannib
-rrb-
,
a
mysteri
stranger
who
is
vagu
enough
about
hi
past
to
make
bobbi
's
mom
suspici
enough
to
at
least
momentarili
turn
her
head
away
from
the
mirror
.

ted
teach
hi
young
neighbor
about
the
wonder
of

-lrb-
after
hi

even
pay

to
read

and
keep
hi
eye
peel
for
the
low
men
,
a
group
of
peopl
chase
ted
to
exploit
hi
special
power
.

I
wo
n't
go
into
what
these
power
are
,
but
they
're
consider
tone
down
from
the
book
-lrb-
and
do
n't
involv
black
stuff
fli
out
of
ted
's
mouth
,
a

.

atlanti
'
present-day
set
which
bookend
the
film
is
base
on
the
novel
's
final
chapter
,
titl
heavenli
shade
of
night
are
fall
,
and
featur
david
mors
-lrb-
in
yet
anoth
connect
to
the
green
mile
-rrb-
as
a
marri
,
middle-ag
bobbi
who
learn
of
the
death
of
both
of
hi
childhood
friend
and
return
to
the
dilapid
board
hous
in
which
he
spent
hi
form
year
.

atlanti
is
nowher
near
as
flashi
as
hick
'
cedar
,
which
is
disappoint
but
understand
consid
the
switch
from
the
complet
amaz
robert
richardson
to
the
occasion
amaz
piotr
sobocinski
,
the
oscar-nomin
cinematograph
behind
krzysztof
kieslowski
's
red
.

the
act
is
solid
from
everyon
,
includ
hopkin
,
who
never
onc
make
you
think
of
dr.
lecter
.

most
impress
are
youngster
yelchin
and
boorem
,
who
both
had
tini
part
in
along
came
a
spider
.

while
I
did
n't
realli
have
much
of
a
problem
with
goldman
's
screenplay
,
I
do
need
to
point
out
at
least
one
inconsist
.

goldman
,
for
those
of
you
who
do
n't
read
premier
,
write
what
seem
like
an
annual
critic
of
everybodi
els
's
film
,
care
explain
whi
they
all
suck
,
make
no
sens
and
insult
their
audienc
,
while
somehow
fail
to
mention
the
crap
that
he
's
pen
-lrb-
like
the
gener
's
daughter
-rrb-
.

It
's
mean-spirit
but
fun
to
read
,
mostli
on
account
of
nobodi
els
in
hollywood
have
the
ball
to
say
anyth
remot
neg
about
anybodi
els
in
the
busi
-lrb-
includ
michael
jackson
,
o.j.
and
robert
blake
-rrb-
.

In
atlanti
,
which
is
suppos
to
be
told
through
the
eye
of
young
bobbi
,
one
would
assum
he
would
have
to
be
in
each
scene
in
order
to
have
the
memori
to
which
to
flash
back
.

well
,
he
's
not
,
and
it
doe
n't
make
sens
.
