with
non-stop
laugh
an
a
abund
of
crude
humor
``
deuc
bigalow
:
male
gigolo
''
is
sometim
like
last
year
hit
``
there
's
someth
about
mari
''
that
is
offens
but
veri
funni
.

the
screenplay
by
harri
goldberg
and
rob
schneider
himself
is
a
smart
,
clever
and
witti
screenplay
that
seem
to
have
been
written
with
care
to
make
is
so
hilari
funni
.

the
charact
in
the
film
are
all
actual
likabl
especi
``
jabba
ladi
''
with
her
big
bodi
but
soft
heart
.

there
are
actual
time
in
the
movi
where
I
fell
out
of
my
chair
laugh
so
hard
that
my
stomach
wa
kill
me
.

even
though
I
thought
``
toy
stori
2
''
and
``
be
john
malkovich
''
were
the
funniest
of
the
year
``
deuc
bigalow
''
follow
right
behind
them
.

the
direct
by
mike
mitchel
is
fantast
and
show
he
took
time
on
the
film
.

rob
schneider
give
a
surprisingli
endear
perform
and
when
hi
romanc
develop
with
one
of
hi
custom
kate
-lrb-
arija
bareiki
-rrb-
it
is
a
sweet
romanc
that
we
get
involv
in
and
actual
like
be
involv
in
it
.

``
deuc
bigalow
''
is
a
good-natur
film
worth
all
the
merit
it
can
get
.

it
not
a
classic
or
a
masterpiec
,
it
's
just
a
comedi
that
we
do
n't
feel
bad
about
watch
.

sure
it
may
come
off
as
offens
and
may
come
off
as
dumb
sometim
,
but
you
can
not
deni
that
it
is
n't
funni
.

``
deuc
bigalow
:
male
gigolo
''
is
no
disappoint
.

it
a
fast
pace
,
entertain
sweet
and
hilari
comedi
that
may
be
destin
to
becom
a
cult
classic
.

fan
of
schneider
will
not
be
disappoint
and
fan
of
crude
but
nice
comedi
will
not
either
.

for
some
reason
the
film
garner
an
R
rate
but
with
no
``
f
word
''
or
extens
use
of
sexual
content
or
explicit
nuditi
I
wa
realli
wonder
whi
the
film
wa
R
.

A
mild
R
to
put
it
to
the
least
,
but
even
if
your
under
17
or
abov
at
least
13
thi
film
is
good
enough
for
you
to
see
.

Do
n't
tri
to
be
one
of
those
peopl
who
make
so
much
of
a
film
that
they
do
not
like
it
,
just
sit
back
,
laugh
and
enjoy
the
movi
.
