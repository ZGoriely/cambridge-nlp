It

hour
for
music

to
``

both
figur
and
liter

like
the
children

the

start
from
the
dark

and
work
it
way
up
to

her

one
when
she
meet
a

who
introduc
her
to
a

teacher
at

school

she
soon
find
her
job
is
on
the
rock
as
the
men
in
her
life
continu
to
rotat
through
revolv
door
.

that
is
the
pattern-lik
plot
of
thi
product
.

ultim
,
the
film
choos
a
zero-sum
answer
to
these
problem
and
find
her
music
career
at
an
all-tim
high
when
the
men
in
her
life
final
vanish
.

the
first
hour
of
music
of
the
heart
is
rather
pain
.

roberta
's
charact
lack
develop
and
consequ
seem
to
be
flat
.

also
lack
depth
is
the
film
's
``
bad
guy
,
''
a
narrow-mind
music
teacher
-lrb-
josh
pai
-rrb-
who
reject
roberta
out
of
principl
-lrb-
the
movi
never
explain
exactli
which
principl
that
is
-rrb-
and
conveni
come
and
goe
from
the
plot
accord
to
when
it
might
be
dramat
to
have
a
villain
around
.

the
nextminut
of
the
film
are
mediocr
.

they
are
highlight
by
one
child
's
return
to
roberta
's
class
-lrb-
come
after
the
great
old
hollywood
scene
where
he
explain
be
ca
n't
be
around
anymor
becaus
``
My
mom
said
...
''
-rrb-
and
a
glow
concert
.

not
know
the
run
time
,
you
may
expect
the
credit
to
role
at
thi
point
.

but
they
do
n't
.

instead
the
film
use
the
nextminut
to
finish
it
journey
from
bad
to
mediocr
to
excel
.

director
we
craven
,
known
for
hi
work
of
horror
,
use
some
old
sentiment
trick
to
get
the
audienc
tear
.

one
romant
break
up
scene
is
highlight
by
the
classic
``
but
...
last
night
...
''
and
roberta
's
two
children
also
have
textbook
conflict
with
their
singl
mother
regard
their
father
's
absenc
.

the
citi
of
harlem
play
a
strong
role
in
the
movi
.

roberta
's
mother
is
initi
reluct
to
see
her
daughter
move
to
that
part
of
town
and
the
film
doe
noth
to
combat
that
stereotyp
.

the
nois
track
for
these
scene
are
domin
by
siren
;
predict
one
of
roberta
's
student
is
gun
down
and
kill
off
screen
.

one
thing
the
film
doe
lack
is
subtleti
.

the
fact
that
a
littl
boy
wa
play
``
We
shall
overcom
''
on
hi
violin
after
the
aforement
shoot
wa
a
cute
and
discreet
refer
.

the
fact
that
the
entir
orchestra
begin
to
play
it
over
and
over
soon
after
is
an
overdon
refer
that
show
how
littl
credit
he
give
the
audienc
.

-lrb-
Of
cours
,
in
horror
film
the
foreshadow
and
between-the-lin
moment
are
meant
to
be
overdon
,
so
perhap
he
too
is
just
learn
to
play
the
game
.
-rrb-

even
with
all
it
flaw
,
music
of
the
heart
is
a
beauti
film
.

that
is
not
an
excus
for
the
movi
's
poor
begin
.

but
as
I
watch
the
scene
in
carnegi
hall
,
I
thought
of
some
of
the
great
act
that
have
taken
that
stage
.

In
decemb
of
1979
a
comedian
name
andi
kaufman
put
on
a
show
that
will
forev
be
rememb
as
one
of
the
most
origin
in
theatr
histori
.

the
perform
includ
a
dead-on
elvi
impress
,
robin
william
in
disguis
and
a
moment
at
the
end
when
kaufman
announc
he
would
take
the
whole
audienc
out
for
milk
and
cooki
.

So
,
how
did
thi
comic
geniu
choos
to
open
the
show
of
hi
life
?

He
had
a
charact
name
toni
clifton
take
the
stage
for
the
sole
purpos
of
irrit
and
anger
the
audienc
.

perhap
it
is
okay
for
music
of
the
heart
to
start
off
rusti
becaus
just
as
kaufman
had
santa
's
favorit
food
,
thi
movi
ha
an
amaz
final
.
