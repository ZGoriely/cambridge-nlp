that
I
am
,
I
am
somewhat
embarrass
to
admit
that
I
had
not
seen
lawrenc
of
arabia
-lrb-
come
soon
to
dvd
-rrb-
until
onli
recent
.

after
all
,
it
's
consid
by
just
about
everyon
to
be
the
masterpiec
epic
of
director
david
lean
,
who
also
direct
film
such
as
bridg
on
the
river
kwai
,
and
doctor
zhivago
.

So
one
day
,
a
friend
of
mine
loan
me
a
copi
of
the
video
and
I
sat
down
and
watch
it
.

I
wa

someth

be
abl
to
keep
my
attent

now
I
fulli
understand

1963
for
best

,
director
,
edit
,
cinematographi
,

direct
,
music
,
and
sound
.

after
watch
the
film
again
,
I
am
convinc
that
it
is
simpli
one
of
the
finest
work
of
cinemat

david

put

on

line

get
thi

,

the
fact

it

after
watch
the
film
,
the
first
thing
that
came
to
my
mind
wa
,
``
I
've
got
to
do
a
remak
of
thi
film
!
''

but
then
I
thought
about
tri
to
pitch
the
idea
to
a
modern-day
movi
execut
:
``
okay
,
it
's
go
to
be
almost
four
hour
long
and
shot
over
three
month
on
locat
in
the
sahara
desert
.
''

We
are
go
to
need
to
blow
up
a
full-siz
train
becaus
computer-gener
effect
probabl
wont
do
it
justic
.

and
we
are
not
go
to
use
ani
big
star
,
and
wo
n't
have
ani
femal
actor
sinc
there
's
no
love
stori
.
''
''

ye
,
my
friend
,
the
velvet
curtain
fell
on
the
golden-era
of
hollywood
a
long
time
ago
.

but
at
least
we
still
have
the
proof
to
show
all
would-b
produc
and
director
out
there
just
how
good
a
film
can
be
.
