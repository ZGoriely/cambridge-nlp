the

marshal
hi
larg
ensembl
actor
in
a
frantic
pace
caper
comedi
that
make
you
laugh
and
feel
queasi
at
the
same
time
,
the
abov
descript
by
brick
top
be
just
one
exampl
.

the
assemblag
of
actor
and
non-actor
in
rough-and-tumbl
set
give
``
snatch
''
an
earthi
feel
in
it
depict
of
london
's
crimin
underworld
.

the
cast
of
charact
is
too
larg
to
credit
here
,
but
two
of
the
performances-first
among
equal
,
you
might
say-ar
worth
note
.

alan
ford
is
brilliant
as
the
ruthless
,
evil
brick
top
.

when
he
refus
sugar
in
hi
tea
becaus
``
I
'm
sweet
enough
,
''
it
make
you
shiver
,
even
as
you
laugh
.

hi
is
one
of
the
best
gangster
charact
I
've
seen
in
year
.

the
other
outstand
perf
is
given
by
none
other
than
brad
pitt
,
the
name
actor
the
movi
's
popular
may
hang
upon
,
at
least
initi
.

pitt
,
as
mickey
o'neil
,
is
hard
drink
,
hard
fight
,
highli
unreli
and
nearli
incomprehens
with
a
uniqu
irish
brogu
and
dialect
of
the
piker
,
the
irish
travel
of
europ
.

thi
gypsi
brigand
would
steal
the
fill
from
your
teeth
,
especi
if
it
would
benefit
hi
belov
mum
-lrb-
sorcha
cusack
-rrb-
.

when
brick
top
threaten
the
safeti
of
mickey
's
famili
,
he
make
an
enemi
that
can
not
be
stop
.

pitt
put
a
credibl
spin
on
hi
charact
and
doe
some
incred
physic
stuff
,
too
,
as
a
bare-knuckl
boxer
.

the
product
team
behind
the
camera
includ
ritchi
alumni
,
produc
matthew
vaughn
and
lenser
tim
maurice-jon
,
and
other
talent
technic
artist
that
bring
the
hyperact
imagin
of
the
author
to
visual
life
.

there
is
a
patent
feel
to
the
look
of
``
snatch
''
and
``
lock
,
stock
and
two
smoke
barrel
''
that
reek
of
``
signatur
''
for
ritchi
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
thi
will
translat
in
hi
futur
work
.

there
is
so
much
talent
in
the
filmmak
that
I
would
like
to
see
him
branch
out
in
other
direct
.

nonetheless
,
``
snatch
''
is
terrif
sophomor
effort
,
a
darn
good
action
comedi
and
a
hoot
to
boot
.
