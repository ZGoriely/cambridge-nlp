the
most
iron
aspect
of
nuclear
war
is
that
it
doe
n't
have

In

the
idea
--
and
perhap
the
onli
real
option
--
is
to
avoid
war
at

.

thi
is
the
theme
of
sidney

's
``

''
a

``

the

when
the
unit

the
soviet

were
in
static
discord
over
an
issu
that
can
be
summar
in
a
singl
word
:

the

and
they

with

with

A

they

the

--
the
fate
of
the
world
lie
in
the
hand
of
an
autom
,
pre-program
system
that
may
not
be
stoppabl
,
simpli
becaus
the
creator
of
the
war
machin
were
too
effici
in
their
task
to
make
a
no-win
situat
winnabl
.

the
event
in
``
fail-saf
''
are
fascin
becaus
they
're
anyth
but
predict
,
but
the
real
reason
``
fail-saf
''
work
is
becaus
it
understand
more
about
nuclear
war
than
what
exist
within
the
confin
of
it
plot
.

A
key
ingredi
to
the
film
is
it
abil
to
creat
an
ongo
polem
about
nuclear
war
,
commun
,
the
cold
war
,
and
the
unit
state
'
role
in
all
of
it
.

most
of
thi
is
through
the
film
's
use
of
the
charact
groeteschel
-lrb-
walter
matthau
-rrb-
,
an
arrog
civilian
theorist
of
nuclear
weapon
use
who
,
incident
,
is
on
the
presid
's
advis
staff
for
analyz
the
statist
plausibl
of
wage
a
nuclear
war
.

mani
of
the
film
's
most
point
messag
aris
from
discuss
where
groeteschel
is
one
of
the
key
voic
.

earli
in
the
film
,
he
host
a
dinner
parti
where
he
explain
the
import
of
``
strategi
''
in
a
nuclear
assault
to
``
minim
''
casualti
.

``
what
's
the
differ
between
60
million
and
100
million
dead
?
''

a
guest
ask
impati
.

``
forti
million
,
''
groeteschel
respond
wryli
.

the
problem
with
groeteschel
's
mindset
is
that
he
*
believ
*
nuclear
combat
to
be
a
viabl
method
of
war
.

the
onli
differ
to
him
between
nuclear
armageddon
and
convent
warfar
is
the
raw
data
and
the
casualti
total
.

groeteschel
realiz
that
these
weapon
can
destroy
the
world
sever
time
over
.

yet
hi
answer
to
the
arm
race
is
not
to
slow
down
and
tri
to
cool
the
situat
off
,
as
gener
black
-lrb-
dan
o'herlihi
-rrb-
ha
often
recommend
.

On
the
contrari
--
accord
to
groeteschel
,
that
would
lead
to
russia
have
*
more
*
nuclear
weapon
than
the
u.s.
,
which
would
clearli
put
america
at
a
disadvantag
.

such
a
stanc
wa
perhap
the
central
paradox
and
misguid
practic
of
the
arm
race
.

``
fail-saf
''
clearli
see
it
as
one
of
the
central
issu
of
the
cold
war
,
and
,
likewis
,
it
becom
a
central
theme
in
the
film
.

whi
continu
to
build
such
machin
of
mass
destruct
while
alreadi
possess
enough
of
them
to
destroy
the
world
sever
time
over
?

Is
it
wise
?

Is
it
even
logic
?

No
,
not
realli
.

although
``
fail-saf
''
is
more
about
the
issu
of
nuclear
weapon
than
it
is
about
the
polit
ramif
of
commun
,
there
is
a
scene
in
the
film
that
deal
with
commun
in
an
intent
superfici
,
one-sid
sort
of
way
.

again
,
thi
is
achiev
through
groeteschel
,
who
is
easili
the
film
's
most
import
charact
in
term
of
the
larger-them
signific
.

In
addit
to
provid
the
central
``
pro-nuclear
war
''
voic
that
the
film
warn
against
,
he
also
make
key
remark
about
communist
that
show
just
how
much
fear
and
resent
peopl
of
the
period
were
prone
to
when
it
came
to
commun
.

the
context
the
film
use
suggest
that
thi
hatr
wa
often
glib
.

one
of
groeteschel
's
``
logic
''
train
of
thought
ventur
so
far
into
fantasi
theoret
predict
that
it
's
mere
absurd
.

He
label
the
averag
marxist
an
``
unfeel
,
calcul
machin
''
that
will
do
whatev
it
take
to
preserv
itself
.

groeteschel
take
it
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
the
u.s.
drop
the
warhead
on
moscow
,
the
soviet
will
*
instantli
*
surrend
,
for
to
retali
would
invit
counter-measur
that
would
further
destroy
russia
's
home
soil
--
which
must
be
preserv
at
all
cost
.

groeteschel
seem
to
forget
these
peopl
are
human
be
with
emot
;
gener
black
quickli
remind
him
that
the
soviet
would
attack
out
of
reveng
--
as
ani
normal
person
would
.

the
ironi
here
is
groeteschel
's
own
mechan
theoriz
.

He
is
so
quick
to
judg
the
enemi
that
he
doe
n't
even
realiz
hi
own
seemingli
program
thought
pattern
.

onc
the
film
make
it
evid
that
turn
the
u.s.
bomber
will
be
imposs
,
the
question
becom
what
the
*
consequ
*
of
destroy
moscow
will
be
.

just
how
will
the
soviet
union
's
leader
react
,
and
what
can
the
presid
do
to
convey
hi
best
intent
?

-lrb-
just
*
how
*
doe
one
pass
off
the
death
of
million
of
peopl
as
an
*
mishap
*
?
-rrb-

with
the
help
of
hi
translat
buck
-lrb-
larri
hagman
-rrb-
,
the
presid
negoti
at
length
with
the
soviet
leader
,
in
scene
that
prove
amazingli
taut
and
power
in
their
simplic
,
with
lumet
's
long
take
of
fonda
and
hagman
in
the
same
frame
,
exchang
the
dialog
between
the
presid
and
the
soviet
leader
.

without
get
into
too
much
detail
,
I
will
say
that
the
compromis
they
ultim
reach
is
veri
costli
,
yet
necessari
and
as
sensibl
as
possibl
under
the
circumst
.

-lrb-
that
is
,
as
sensibl
as
a
nuclear
``
incid
''
can
probabl
be
.
-rrb-

It
doe
accomplish
what
it
must
:
it
avoid
an
all-out
war
,
someth
that
simpli
is
n't
possibl
becaus
of
it
all-too-r
consequ
.

dramat
,
the
end
is
quit
power
,
and
the
use
of
o'herlihi
's
charact
as
the
symbol
``
matador
''
-lrb-
provid
a
bookend
to
the
film
by
end
the
stori
while
tie
into
hi
dream
sequenc
from
the
film
's
open
-rrb-
,
is
particularli
appropri
.

``
fail-saf
''
is
a
product
of
a
major
hollywood
studio
-lrb-
releas
by
columbia
pictur
-rrb-
,
and
it
ha
the
structur
of
a
high-tens
suspens
thriller
that
one
might
expect
from
a
hollywood
film
.

nevertheless
,
under
lumet
's
direct
and
walter
bernstein
's
intellig
adapt
of
burdick
's
and
wheeler
's
novel
,
the
film
continu
to
have
a
last
effect
even
after
the
event
on
screen
have
unfold
.

the
film
often
warn
that
the
autom
of
war
is
someth
that
may
make
nuclear
holocaust
an
unintent
consequ
of
such
mass
arm
.

but
it
wa
the
consciou
,
human
choic
to
*
initi
*
thi
automat
arm
that
``
fail-saf
''
also
find
danger
.

In
retrospect
,
the
arm
race
seem
to
be
one
of
the
most
puzzl
exercis
in
futil
of
the
centuri
.

It
's
just
fortun
that
both
side
were
final
abl
to
come
to
their
sens
and
slow
down
,
rather
than
continu
groeteschel
's
danger
approach
of
speed
up
and
caus
a
possibl
meltdown
.
