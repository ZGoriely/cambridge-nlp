A
movi
that
is
well
script

well
act
,

ha
an
unexpect
twist
at
the
end
that
pack
a
punch

It
is

direct
hi
own
script
,
maintain
a
proper
tension
throughout
the
film
and
craft
the
storytel
so
expertli
that
the
film
's
full
impact
is
not
reach
until
it
final
moment
,
when
a
surpris
revel
forc
a
reevalu
of
all
that
preced
it
.

It
is
a
rare
movi
which
manag
to
pull
that
off
and
mr.
shyamalan
,
as
the
one
respons
,
is
certainli
to
be
commend
.

In
give
the
sixth
sens
a
favor
``
three
star
''
review
for
it
craftsmanship
and
artist
merit
,
I
must
also
point
out
that
,
spiritu
speak
,
the
film
is
highli
mislead
.

there
is
no
scriptur
foundat
upon
which
to
base
a
belief
in
ghost
or
the
``
live
dead
.
''

the
concept
of
death
be
a
doorway
to
anoth
plane
of
exist
is
a
devilish
lie
that
ha
been
around
as
long
as
man
himself
.

the
first
lie
record
in
the
bibl
wa
devis
by
the
serpent
who
assur
eve
,
``
thou
shall
not
sure
die
,
''
a
direct
contradict
of
god
's
admonit
.

that
same
lie
ha
been
perpetu
ad
infinitum
throughout
the
age
.

scriptur
do
speak
of
a
time
when
the
dead
shall
rise
but
that
wonder
demonstr
of
victori
over
death
will
not
commenc
until
after
the
second
come
of
christ
...
an
event
which
ha
not
yet
occur
.

therefor
,
the
dead
remain
in
a
state
of
oblivion
,
have
no
conscious
,
until
that
long-await
time
when
the
final
trump
shall
sound
.

and
then
,
you
'll
need
six
sens
to
regist
all
the
joy
and
rejoic
that
will
resound
throughout
the
heaven
.
