the

As
mani
great
movi
that
got
cult
statu
through
the
year
,
taxi
driver
becam
the
object
of
mani
interpret
.

for
some
critic
and
scholar
it
is
an
explor
of
univers
subject
that
date
back
to
dostoyevski-loss
of
moral
compass
in
a
bleak
realiti
of
dirti
,
overpopul
industri
citi
;
the
stori
could
have
been
set
in
19th
centuri
same
as
in
our
time
.

for
other
,
the
movi
use
raskolnikov-lik
figur
in
order
to
portray
burn
problem
of
1970
america-it
appar
inabl
to
deal
with
the
consequ
of
rapid
social
chang
that
occur
in
previou
decad
.

brilliant
perform
of
robert
De
niro
in
role
of
a
lifetim
can
give
argument
for
both
side
.

hi
travi
bickl
ha
a
lot
in
common
with
most
of
the
averag
viewer
of
today-mani
of
us
share
hi
feel
of
isol
,
loneli
and
outrag
toward
crime
,
drug
,
prostitut
and
senseless
street
violenc
.

hi
pathet
attempt
to
establish
some
kind
of
human
connect
with
the
peopl
around
him
,
sometim
in
most
unusu
circumstances-lik
with
secret
servic
agent
,
pimp
or
job
interviewers-mak
him
a
person
too
goofi
to
be
the
hero
,
and
too
pathet
to
be
the
classic
villain
.

howev
,
most
of
the
averag
viewer
are
sensibl
enough
to
recognis
the
tin
line
that
separ
concern
citizen
or
troubl
soul
from
fanat
madmen
.

but
despit
anyth
,
averag
viewer
at
the
end
actual
cheer
for
travis-hi
crusad
against
``
scum
''
is
someth
that
averag
person
want
,
but
doe
n't
have
a
stomach/lack
of
brain
to
do
it
.

while
De
niro
's
travi
might
come
in
and
out
of
particular
time
and
place
,
other
person
that
appear
in
the

mostli

give
it
distinct
1970
feel
.

present
the
onli

but

becaus
he
is
the
oldest
taxi

in

therefor

even
the

hi

that
cover
the
lack
of
ani
seriou

ca
n't
fool
even

the

even

seem
bleak
,
and
the
feel
of

away
even
by

travi

hi

found
themselv
in
a
desper

,
and
martin
scorses
use
the
best
of
hi
cinemat
skill
in
order
to
spill
the
gloom
of
schrader
's
screenplay
into
the
silver
screen
.

new

is
portray
as
a
hell
on

,
and
the
red
light

steam
come
out

sewer
give
it
surreal
,
almost
stygian
atmospher
.

anoth
import
element
of
the
atmospher
is
score
of
great
bernard
herrman
,
whose
effici
use
of
jazz
element
give
some
melancholi
that
soften
the
brutal
of
motion

one
of
the
greatest
ironi
of
taxi
driver
is
the
fact
that
the
movi
wa
,
same

famou
