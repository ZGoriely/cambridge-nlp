the
apostl
``
I
'd
rather
die
today
and
go
to

than
live
to
be
a
hundr
and
go
to

,
''
earnestli
proclaim
the
pentecost
preacher
.

with
that
line
come
from
a
fundamentalist
christian
minist
,
hollywood
ha
taught
us
how
we
should
fill
in
the
rest
of
the
stori
.

He
will
be
turn
out
to
be
a
scoundrel
who
ha
less
actual
belief
in
god
than
the
averag
american
,
and
all
of
hi
preach
will
turn
out
to
be
a
cynic
ruse
to
extort
money
from
hi
naiv
congreg
.

from

gantri
on
,
we
have
learn
what
to
expect
when

well
,
think
again
,
for
the

,
which
robert

ha
want
to
make
for
over

,
doe
not
take
the
usual
tack
of
smear
the
minist
,
and
by
implic
all
,
the
rest
of

religion
.

instead
it
give
us
a
highli
devout
man
,
who
certainli
ha
hi
foibl
,
but
with
an
absolut
dedic
to
hi
ministri
and
hi
god
.

and
arguabl
just
as
surpris
,
the
good-spirit
film
is
no
comedi
,
even
if
it
doe
have
humor
moment
.

instead
of
leviti
the
pictur
take
a
touchingli
seriou
approach
as
it
introduc
us
to
a
