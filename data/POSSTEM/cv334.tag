and
goe
away
with
a
beauti
girl
,
just
like
the
guy
at
rekal
promis
him
.

throughout
thi
plot
,
there
is
huge
explos
,
thousand
of
death
-lrb-
and
I
mean
a
lot
of
death
-rrb-
swear
,
sex
,
and
everyth
els
that
make
's
a
good
verhoeven
-lrb-
director
of
basic
instinct
and
starship
trooper
-rrb-
movi
.

natur
,
there
's
some
pretti
imagin
death
,
with
arm
get
rip
off
,
someon
get
drill
,
and
head
explod
.

As
you
can
tell
,
it
's
violent
stuff
.

but
it
's
done
so
stylishli
,
and
of
cours
arni
tone
it
down
with
a
one
liner
,
that
's
it
excus
.

the
act
is
variabl
.

arni
,
of
cours
,
is
useless
,
but
he
goe
ha
some
good
line
,
and
in
the
first
twenti
minut
,
he
even
act
's
like
a
normal
bloke
,
not
like
some
action
hero
.

stone
,
of
cours
,
is
useless
,
make
a
pretti
poor
wife
,
and
a
pretti
poor
action
hero
.

but
,
she
doe
sex
scene
alright
.

ticoton
-lrb-
most
recent
seen
in
con
air
-rrb-
,
again
,
is
OK
,
do
some
good
action
,
but
get
her
emot
all
wrong
.

one
minut
she
hate
quaid
,
the
next
she
love
him
,
and
she
never
get
thi
tranisit
right
.

So
,
the
good
guy
are
aw
.

but
,
the
bad
guy
's
are
excel
.

cox
is
basic
repris
robocop
,
but
he
's
still
great
in
thi
,
and
he
deliv
the
best
line
in
the
whole
film
near
the
end
.

ironsid
is
superbl
evil
,
with
an
utterli
emotionless
face
.

the
support
cast
are
fine
,
and
not
even
the
comedi
sidekick
-lrb-
thi
time
in
the
form
of
a
taxi
driver
-rrb-
is
annoy
.

one
disappoint
aspect
,
though
,
are
the
special
effect
.

ilm
and
dreamquest
do
some
good
work
-lrb-
such
as
a
subway
station
scene
-rrb-
but
the
model
work
is
not
so
good
.

some
of
the
model
head
look
appal
fake
,
and
quatto
is
a
major
disappoint
.

anoth
irrit
thing
is
the
product
placement
.

there
are
a
lot
of
plug
-lrb-
and
a
good
mar
today
gag
-rrb-
howev
,
the
set
look
great
,
and
the
special
effect
at
the
end
of
the
film
are
n't
too
bad
either
.

there
's
also
a
good
soundtrack
run
through
,
by
jerri
goldsmith
-lrb-
the
omen
,
poltergeist
,
star
trek
:
the
motion
pictur
-rrb-
overal
,
then
,
total
recal
is
a
huge
violent
,
yet
huge
enjoy
,
action
fest
,
with
a
reason
plot
thrown
in
there
too
,
some
great
bad
guy
,
and
some
imaganit
death
.

for
a
schwarzenegg
movi
,
thi
is
not
bad
at
all
.

In
fact
,
it
's
veri
good
.
