He

start
to
crawl
toward
it
,
he
then
get
suck
to
the
end
and
end
up
in
john

.

fifteen

is
outstand
and
utterli

in
a
role
onli
he
himself
could
play
.

He
fit
the
role
perfectli
and
to
me
wa
brilliantli
cast
.

cameron
diaz

outstand
and
utterli
one
of
the
world
's
most
prettiest
women
,
is
made
up
here
unnotic

unattract
.

she
howev
give
a
veri
comic
perform
and
thi
could
easili
be
her
best
role
to
date
.

catherin
keener
is
veri
funni
and
sexi
as
maxin
and
of
cours
the
best
thing
of
the
movi
is
the
magic
himself
john
malkovich
who
is
veri
brilliant
and
thi
movi
play
big
time
homag
to
the
master
himself
.

the
whole
group
combin
give
us
a
wonder
funni
movi
that
is
also
smart
and
clever
.

spike
jonz
-lrb-
three
king
-rrb-
make
hi
fabul
direct
debut
,
and
did
a
fantast
job
of
direct
thi
new
classic
film
.

He
let
the
viewer
go
on
the
trip
as
well
as
let
the
viewer
know
they
are
watch
a
movi
.

By
the
time
the
end
roll
around
my
head
wa
spin
from
disbelief
of
how
good
thi
film
wa
.

the
screenplay
written
by
charli
kaufman
wa
hilari
and
often
thought-provok
.

the
film
also
had
a
soft
side
to
it
and
even
though
the
end
is
veri
surpris
it
is
also
a
littl
sad
and
heart-warm
.

the
whole
movi
wa
fantast
and
had
me
roll
in
the
isl
.

from
cameron
diaz
's
appear
to
john
malkovich
's
explor
I
laugh
veri
hard
,
and
it
may
as
well
be
as
funni
as
As
good
As
It
get
-lrb-
the
funniest
!
-rrb-
.

there
is
n't
a
slow
point
in
the
movi
,
or
an
overus
idea
.

there
are
no
clich
except
for
the
fact
that
thi
is
the
most
origin
,
inventi
,
witti
,
and
smart
movi
I
've
seen
in
a
long
time
.

I
found
myself
amaz
by
everyth
:
the
direct
,
act
,
write
and
the
whole
idea
of
the
movi
.

By
the
end
I
had
to
wonder
whi
hollywood
doe
n't
want
to
make
movi
like
thi
anymor
.

Or
whi
they
do
n't
.

all
filmmak
watch
thi
movi
and
get
some
idea
of
movi
to
come
out
.

thi
wa
a
surpris
hit
as
wa
american
beauti
.

`
be
john
malkovich
'
is
in
the
topmovi
of
the
year
,
and
in
the
topbest
film
ever
made
.

It
ha
someth
that
no
other
movi
play
now
ha
.

In
fact
it
may
as
well
be
the
best
movi
out
right
now
.

I
highli
recommend
`
be
john
malkovich

and
have
no
doubt

be
disappoint
