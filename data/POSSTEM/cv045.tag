oddli
enough
,
desmond

-lrb-
who
play

is
well
known
as
a
pioneer
in
the
realm

as
the
perform
ninjaman

and
he
doe
n't
contribut
a

song
to
the
film
-lrb-
that
I
could
see
-rrb-
,
which
is
virtual
unheard
of
here
in
the
US
.

At
the
time
of
thi
write
,
third
world
cop
ha
been
put
into
limit
theatric
releas
in
the
US
,
come
off
of
a
six-month
box-offic
break
run
in
jamaica
,
where
it
hold
the
posit
as
highest
gross
film
of
all
time
-lrb-
bring
in
$
21
million
in
jamaica
,
which
is
roughli
$
500,000

.

palm

-lrb-
the
compani
that
releas
the
offbeat
,
but
entertain
six-str
samurai
-rrb-
is
the
compani
releas
the
film
and
consid
that
their
main
focu
is
the
dvd
market
,
I
can
imagin
that
a
disc
will
be
avail
onc
the
film
ha
left

.

chri
blackwel
,
founder
of
palm
pictur
,
wa
also
involv
in
the
product
of
anoth
jamaican
box-offic
smash
in
1981
entitl
countryman
,
so
I
'd
say
he
ha
a
pretti
good
track
record
.

overal
,
third
world
cop
is
a
pretti
entertain
homag
to
the
film
of
john
woo
,
ringo
lam
,
tsui
hark
,
and
mani
other
action
film
by
director
from
hong
kong
.

If
action
film
are
your
thing
and
you
do
n't
mind
intermitt
subtitl
,
then
you
ca
n't
go
wrong
with
thi
film
.

the
perform
and
the
stori
are
solid
-lrb-
if
onli
a
littl
clich
-rrb-
and
the
action
is
tight
.

I
'm
not
sure
what
the
other
jamaican
film
releas
in
that
countri
are
like
,
but
appar
third
world
cop
's
honor
are
well
deserv
.
