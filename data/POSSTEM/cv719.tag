if

take
a

look

for
thi

moustach

with

that

he
is
perfectli

-lrb-
It
's
anoth
of
john
mcnaughton
's
coup
of
casting-against-typ
,
after
transform
robert
de
niro
into
nerd
and
bill
murray
into
gangster
in
mad

and
glori

but
it
is
the
charact
of
pam
who
command

,
and
ashley
judd
rise
to
the
challeng
with
great
altern
current
of
feroc
and
tender
,
make
pam
into
a
fascin
yet
often
infuri
person
.

If
the
perform
fall
short
of
great
,
howev
,
it
is
perhap
becaus
the
role
of
the
mad
woman
ha
been
done
so
often
befor
it
is
virtual
a
stapl
of
cinema
,
whether
it
's
in
betti

,
tom

or
georgia
.

As
in
those
movi
,
there
's
the
danger
that
the
perform
seem
manner
,
a
collect
of
screwi
tic
and
tantrum
design
for
the
oscar
present
piec
.

judd
doe
n't
entir
avoid
thi
pitfal
,
but
pam
's
`
crazi
'
is
best
and
most
movingli
present
in
counterpoint
to
the
more
`
normal
'
chri
.

when
pam
react
to
her
father-in-law
's
death
by
show
up
at
the
funer
in
rollerblad
and
blare
headphon
,
chri
'
face
is
the
pictur
of
pain
restraint
.

Of
cours
,
it
's
the
question
of
what
is
`
normal
'
that
is
ask
in
normal
life
.

mcnaughton
constantli
offer
up
the
ironi
of
the
aspir
for
the
averag
domest
life
and
it
kinship
with
insan
.

It
is
the
ration
chri
that
love
gun
-lrb-
``
shoot
is
about
precis
,
control
''
-rrb-
and
the
`
crazi
'
pam
that
love
astronomi
and
yearn
for
a
dog
-lrb-
who
is
then
call
chao
--
``
chao
and
you
and

we
're
a

,

It
is
chri
'
method
mind
and
hi
knowledg
of

that
allow
him
to
be
such
a

bank

-lrb-
hi

In
the

where
he
set

robberi
,
a
huge
sign
on
a

stand
out
in

background
:
``

--
the
perfectli

consumption-crazi
american
dream
that
ha
driven
pam
to
her
extravag
purchas
,
and
both
of
them
into
desper

It
's
not
a
perfect
film
.

some
of
the
dialogu
is
a
touch
too
banal
-lrb-
perhap
intent
?
-rrb-
.

the
use
of
the
punk
hardcor
soundtrack
in
pam
's
craze
scene
come
rather
too
close
to
make
emot
disturb
seem
glamour
and
sexi
an
imag
which
onli
detract
from
the
rest
of
the
film
.

inde
,
as
in
mcnaughton
's
semin
film
henri
:
portrait
OF
A
serial
killer
,
it
is
the
avoid
of
glamour
or
sensation
,
the
denial
of
some
of
the
standard
thrill
of
the
outlaw
film
genr
,
that
give
thi
determinedli
unflashi

it
great
strength
.

mcnaughton
ha
film
thi
stori
with
a
quiet
,
coolli
`
realist
'
method
that
work
far
better
than
ani

theatric
at
unsettl
the
viewer
.

the
suburb
,
with
their
mile
of
white-fenc
hous
and
identikit
mall
,
take
on
a
sens
of
claustrophob
blank
.

In
it
veri
differ
way
,
thi
make
for
as
haunt
a
backdrop
as
the
wide
open
space
in
terenc
malick
's
badland
.

while
pam
share
the
yearn
of
malick
's
hero
to
escap
from
ordinari
life
,
chri
take
up
crime
precis
so
that
they
can
lead
a
`
normal
life
'
-
their
littl
hous
on
the
suburb
is
financ
by
hi
violent
robberi
.

but
these
are
dream
defin
by
,
constrain
by
,
and
even
doom
by
,
the
limit
of
the
`
normal
'
,
convent
world
.

pam
's
final
scene
take
place
at
the
edg
of
the
suburb
,
where
wild
bush
grow
--
symbol
the
frontier
,
the
outer
limit
of
her
societi
,
but
also
quit
liter
the
end
of
the
road
,
where
there
is
nowher
left

to
the
final
tragic
denouement
