.

derek
doe
not
resist
the
cop
,
and
as
they
spin
him
around
to
cuff
him
,
the
film
slow
down
.

derek
rais
hi
eyebrow
and
smile
at
hi
littl
brother
in
a
chill
,
sadist
,
satisfi
grin
.

now
in
prison
,
derek
face
new
challeng
.

As
the
black
man
in
the
laundri
tell
him
,
``
in
the
joint
,
you
the
nigra
,
not
me
.
''

there
is
a
cliqu
of
swastika-wear
skinhead
,
but
they
are
not
interest
in
the
ideolog
of
white
supremaci
.

they
onli
use
the
symbol
as
a
mean
of
intimid
.

derek
find
himself
truli
alon

truli
in
danger
,
and
truli
afraid
.

when
derek
final
get
out
of

,
he
find
that
hi
friend
from
the
gang
have
also
chang
.

without
derek
's
leadership
,
they
have
shun
the
white
supremacist
ideolog
for
the
white
supremacist
cultur
.

It
is
the
final
factor
that
make
him
realiz
how
badli
he
's
screw
up
.

In
the
end
,
he
spend
qualiti
time
with
is
brother
tri
to
undo
the
respect
and
admir
he
had
earlier
inspir
in
danni
.

the
film
end
a
littl
too
deliber
,
too
neatli
after
the
unchain
emot
and
violent
glee
of
the
rest
of
the
film
,
but
it
bare
detract
from
the
overal
experi
.

edward
norton
give
an
oscar-worthi
perform
.

although
some
of
hi
dialogu
seem
to
be
written
without
enough
convict
,
norton
's
perform
compens
.

-lrb-
An
exampl
that
come
to
mind
is
hi
pep
talk
befor
loot
the
store
.
-rrb-

He
also
captur
the
essenc
of
an
older
brother
.

He
took
hi
respons
as
a
role
model
to
hi
younger
brother
veri
serious
,
veri
lovingli
,
both
befor
and
after
hi
chang
of
heart
.

though
clearli
not
for
all
tast
,
thi
film
is
bold
and
dare
.

the
subject
matter
is
ugli
,
cruel
,
and
at
time
hard
to
look
at
.

nevertheless
it
subject
are
part
of
human
's
great
face
.

kay
give
us
a
good
look
at
thi
fascin
,
if
distast
