As
a
scienc
fiction
action-thril
,
robocop
is
extrem
effect
.

dutch
director
paul
verhoeven
combin
gritti
action
with
suspens
,
shock
gore
,
and
spectacular
special
effect
.

sever
sequenc
in
the
film
,
such
as
the
one
in
which
robocop
employ
hi
extrem
precis
aim
to
stop
a
rapist
,
are
destin
to
becom
cult-class
.

becaus
robocop
is
so
visual
and
emot
rous
,
it
demand
to
be
seen
on
a
larg
screen
with
an
audienc
--
in
other
word
,
in
a
movi
theater
.

although
the
special
effect
and
action
are
excit
,
they
do
not
by
themselv
set
robocop
apart
from
other
film
in
the
genr
.

rather
,
robocop
stand
out
for
it
accur
and
bite
satir
of
american
societi
.

the
movi
make
a
mockeri
of
the
star
war
defens
initi
,
terror
,
board
game
,
and
televis
news
broadcast
with
air-head
anchor
.

these
news
broadcast
,
which
are
except
clever
,
recur
period
throughout
the
movi
and
help
to
provid
comic
relief
from
the
intens
action
and
gore
.

the
satir
in
robocop
,
howev
,
is
almost
as
frighten
in
it
own
way
as
the
suspens
and
blood
.

1990
's
america
,
as
portray
in
the
film
,
may
seem
far
fetch
but
is
in
actual
-lrb-
I
think
-rrb-
onli
a
slight
exagger
of
the
current
state
of
american
societi
.

the
humor
satir
in
robocop
is
simultan
credibl
and
absurd
.

verhoeven
adroitli
balanc
the
satir
comedi
with
the
gori
action
to
creat
an
entertain
and
enlighten
piec
of
scienc
fiction/soci
commentari
.

unfortun
,
robocop
possess
sever
flaw
which
prevent
it
from
qualifi
as
a
classic
within
the
genr
.

the
movi
lack
the
last
impact
of
such
film
as
the
road
warrior
,
the
termin
,
and
alien
.

robocop
's
main
problem
,
asid
from
it
dumb
titl
,
is
that
it
doe
not
suffici
develop
murphi
's
charact
.

We
never
learn
the
degre
to
which
murphi
-lrb-
as
robocop
-rrb-
is
human
and
the
degre
to
which
he
is
a
robot
.

doe
murphi
have
ani
human
spirit
or
free
will
left
,
or
is
he
mere
a
comput
follow
a
program
?

the
script
halfheartedli
rais
these
issu
but
then
abandon
them
in
it
climact
flurri
of
gori
action
.

moreov
,
it
almost
complet
ignor
the
question
-lrb-
and
tragedi
-rrb-
of
deni
a
man
hi
right
to
die
in
favor
of
turn
him
into
a
machin
.

robocop
also
contain
sever
bothersom
loose-end
.

As
you
watch
robocop
,
you
experi
deja
vu
;
you
feel
as
if
you
have
seen
the
film
befor
.

In
mani
respect
,
robocop
is
reminisc
of
sever
other
film
,
includ
the
termin
,
return
OF
the
jedi
,
and
even
death
wish
.

howev
,
to
it
credit
,
robocop
easili
ha
enough
origin
and
uniqu
person
to
avoid
becom
a
cheap
rip-off
.
