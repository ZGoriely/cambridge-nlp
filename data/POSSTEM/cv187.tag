In

By
now
you
must
be
awar
of
the
premis
:
unbeknownst
to
him
,
truman
-lrb-
carrey
-rrb-
is
the
star
of
hi
own
TV
seri
,
a
24-7
peep-show
in
which
he

actor
and

situat

peopl
around

tune
in
for
the
voyeurist
thrill
of
hi
genuin
reaction

`
seahaven
'
,
hi
hometown
,
and
the
show
itself
,
are
the
brainchild
of
christof
-lrb-
harri
-rrb-
,
who
presid
over
hi
creation
in
the
base
of
a
fake
moon
,
direct
over
500
camera
and
hundr
of
actor
and
extra
.

for
30
year
,
truman
suspect
noth
-
`
We
accept
the
realiti
we
're
given
,
'
pose
christof-but
a
desir
to
break
free
of
the
sunni
town
and
visit
a
long
lost
love
in
`
fiji

-lrb-
mcelhon
,
who
wa
actual
an
actress
fire
by
christof
for
tri
to
break
the
confidenti
agreement
-rrb-
overwhelm
him
.

thu
,
christof
and
hi
team
suddenli
find
themselv
work
twice
as
hard
to
keep
the
veneer
of
seahaven
intact
,
lest
truman
discov
the
world
outsid
and
put
an
end
to
the
highly-r
program
.

In
a
few
broad
stroke
,
weir
creat
a
convinc
second-r
,
and
he
ha
the
good
sens
not
to
bring
christof
into
the
pictur
until
almost
three-quart
through
.

thi
allow
us
to
comprehend
and
accept
truman
's
world
befor
we
contextu
it
.

for
all
hi
mad
,
christof
ha
shown
the
world
a
place
without
violenc
and
hardship
,
and
demonstr
that
a
human
be
can
function
well
within
it
.

truman
is
an
inspir
to
hi
audienc
becaus
he
grew
up
to
be
,
well
,
so
darn
nice
;
like
a
sibl
-lrb-
or
,
perhap
more
appropri
,
a
cage
anim
in
an
interact
zoo
-rrb-
,
they
want
to
see
him
succeed
.

the
surrealist
soap
opera
is
complet
plausibl
thank
to
a
tight
screenplay
and
a
sympathet
carrey-h
realli
is
an
everyman
here
,
abandon
hi
facial
contort
in
favour
of
a
credibl
,
wide-ey
bewilder
.

cinemat
,
the
truman
show
is
impecc
,
stylishli
photograph
by
peter
biziou

with

As

If
the
film
ha
ani
flaw
,
one
may
find
them
in
laura
linney
's
character
as
meryl
,
truman
's
``

-lrb-
I
doubt
that
betti

would
fool
anyon
-rrb-
,
and
in
a
subplot
involv
truman
's
`
father
'
,
which
feel
curious
incomplet
.

there
are
a
few
stupend
sequenc
,
and
the
film
pull
off
a
wonder
trick
:
we
becom
truman
's
audienc
as
much
as
the
loyal
viewer
in
the
film
.

they
wear
button
ask
`
how
will
it
end
?
'

I
could
n't
wait
to
know
myself
,
though
I
did
n't
exactli
want
it
to
end
,
for
thi

possibl
the
best-and
most
