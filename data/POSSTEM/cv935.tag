.

then

then
,
it
wa

.

final
,
I
just
gave
up
tri
to
come
up
with
a
tag
line
and
decid
to
say
...
there
's
a
lot
of
fli
go
on
in
thi
film
!

As
our
first
host
steve
martin
tell
us
,
the
origin
concept
behind
fantasia
wa
to
bring
it
out
everi
year
with
some
old
segment
retain
and
some
new
segment
ad
in
.

well
appar
that
plan
fell
by
the
waysid
for
a
while
,
becaus
approxim
sixti
year
have
pass
sinc
the
origin
classic
wa
releas
.

part
of
thi
might
have
someth
to
do
with
the
cold
recept
the
film
got
when
it
wa
first
releas
in
1940
-lrb-
gross
somewher
close
to
$
110,000
in
it
origin
month
of
releas
-rrb-
.

subsequ
re-releas
of
the
film
have
elev
the
popular
of
the
film
to
the
classic
statu
it
ha
final
achiev
-lrb-
and
right
deserv
-rrb-
.

To
celebr
the
releas
of
an
updat
version
of
fantasia
,
disney
and
imax
team
up
to
present
the
anim
film
in
a
fashion
no
one
had
seen
befor
:
six
stori
high
.

In
an
exclus
four
month
engag
-lrb-
from
januari
1st
to
april
30th
,
2000
-rrb-
,
fantasia
2000
can
be
seen
at
mani
imax
theater
across
the
US
.

after
the
engag
is
over
,
the
film
will
be
shown
at
regular
theater
.

Is
the
format
effect
for
the
film
?

with
a
few
except
,
ye
.

the
first
segment
we
are
present
with
is
set
to
beethoven
's
fifth
symphoni
.

It
's
hard
to
describ
exactli
what
thi
segment
is
about
,
but
it
involv
a
bunch
of
brightli
color
butterfli
look
triangl
flit
about
happili
.

everyth
seem
to
be
go
great
for
these
littl
thing
until
the
ground
erupt
with
swarm
of
evil
,
black
bat-lik
triangl
that
attack
and
engulf
their
lighter
counterpart
.

eventu
,
shaft
of
light
from
abov
help
drive
away
the
evil
bat-lik
thing
and
peac
return
to
the
butterfli
thing
.

though
thi
segment
is
n't
veri
stori
driven
,
some
of
the
imag
are
veri
visual
strong
,
especi
the
scene
in
which
the
dark
cloud
of
bat
thing
-lrb-
who
are
all
outlin
in
blood
red
color
-rrb-
begin
to
overtak
the
sky
.

the
next
segment
is
set
to
ottorino
respighi
's
``
the
pine
of
rome
''
.

In
thi
segment
,
some
humpback
whale
swim
happili
through
the
ocean
and
eventu
emerg
from
the
water
and
fli
around
the
massiv
iceberg
that
pepper
the
oceanscap
.

A
whale
calf
get
into
a
scuffl
with
some
nearbi
bird
dure
the
flight
and
end
up
get
trap
in
a
giant
iceberg
he
smash
into
while
tri
to
avoid
the
bird
attack
.

He
is
final
save
-lrb-
by
anoth
liber
shaft
of
light
-rrb-
and
he
and
hi
brethren
take
to
the
sky
and
fli
into
the
upper
atmospher
where
they
frolic
in
the
``
ocean
''
of
cloud
.

again
,
visual
are
the
key
with
thi
segment
,
especi
where
the
whale
are
involv
.

reportedli
the
whale
,
as
view
on
an
imax
screen
in
certain
sequenc
,
are
shown
as
actual
size
.

the
cgi
whale
look
incred
life-lik
,
except
for
some
googli
cartoon
eye
drawn
onto
the
imag
.

one
especi
strike
imag
involv
the
giant
shadow
of
one
of
the
whale
be
cast
through
the
wall
of
an
iceberg
as
the
whale
calf
tri
to
find
a
way
out
to
it
parent
.

absolut
beauti
stuff
.

the
third
segment
-lrb-
and
the
least
of
the
eight
segment
-rrb-
is
set
to
georg
gershwin
's
``
rhapsodi
in
blue
''
.

thi
segment
is
design
as
a
tribut
to
acclaim
caricaturist
Al
hirschfeld
,
and
intertwin
four
differ
stori
about
sad
soul
live
in
depress
era
new
york
.

there
's
a
construct
worker
who
dream
of
be
a
jazz
drummer
,
an
out-of-work
sad
sack
that
dream
of
have
a
job
,
a
young
girl
that
dream
of
spend
time
with
her
parent
instead
of
be
hustl
off
by
a
schoolmarm
,
and
a
nebbish
who
dream
of
be
free
from
hi
overbear
wife
.

I
wo
n't
go
into
how
everyth
work
out
,
but
in
fine
disney
tradit
there
is
a
happi
end
.

unfortun
,
the
stori
drag
quit
a
bit
and
the
seem
out
of
place
within
the
hyper
realiti
of
the
rest
of
the
segment
.

segment
four
is
set
to
dmitri
shostakovich
's
``
piano
concerto
no.
2
''
and
is
an
anim
version
of
han
christian
andersen
's
``
the
steadfast
tin
soldier
''
.

A
one
leg
toy
tin
soldier
fall
in
love
with
a
wind-up
clock
ballerina
-lrb-
whom
he
assum
is
also
one
leg
becaus
he
ca
n't
see
her
other
leg
extend
out
behind
her
-rrb-
,
much
to
the
dismay
of
an
evil
jack-in-the-box
jester
.

the
jester
knock
the
soldier
out
of
a
window
and
continu
pursu
the
ballerina
.

littl
doe
the
jester
know
,
the
soldier
ha
been
deposit
in
the
sewer
and
ha
journey
through
the
pipelin
onli
to
be
swallow
by
a
fish
that
ha
been
captur
and
sold
to
the
owner
of
the
set
of
tin
soldier
that
the
one
leg
one
come
from
.

the
soldier
eventu
save
the
day
and
get
the
girl
.

although
the
end
ha
been
alter
from
the
andersen
stori
,
``
the
steadfast
tin
soldier
''
is
decent
told
with
in
the
framework
of
a
seven
minut
short
.

some
children
may
find
the
jester
to
be
a
littl
frighten
,
but
otherwis
the
segment
is
well
made
.

segment
five
is
the
funniest
of
the
bunch
.

set
to
camil
saint-saen
``
the
carniv
of
the
anim
''
,
thi
segment
featur
a
flamingo
tortur
hi
fellow
flamingo
with
a
yo-yo
while
they
are
tri
to
perform
a
choreograph
danc
number
.

while
it
is
the
shortest
clip
of
the
group
and
a
throwback
to
the
allig
and
hippo
danc
in
the
first
fantasia
,
it
is
still
well
accomplish
and
a
welcom
bit
of
comedi
.

segment
six
is
the
onli
segment
to
be
repeat
from
the
origin
1940
fantasia
,
and
it
's
the
one
that
peopl
rememb
most
,
``
the
sorcer
's
apprentic
''
.

the
stori
is
the
most
recogniz
,
so
the
draw
here
is
see
it
on
the
enorm
imax
screen
in
remast
stereo
.

unfortun
,
the
segment
wa
n't
made
to
be
present
on
larg
format
film
-lrb-
consid
it
wa
shot
full
frame
-rrb-
and
exhibit
larg
amount
of
grain
.

there
were
at
least
two
occas
where
imag
were
veri
hard
to
make
out
due
to
the
excess
grain
.

similar
problem
crop
up
on
modern
day
releas
when
project

too
larg
for
the
imag
to

accur
-lrb-
but
no
one
seem
to
notic
for
some
strang
reason
-rrb-
,
an
anomali
common
to
mani
18-plu
screen
theater
.

segment
seven
is
set
to
sir
edward
elgar
's
``

and
is
the
onli
other
fantasia
segment
to

``

as
an
assist
to

whose
task
is

dure
the

donald
and
hi

lose
sight
of

and
both
believ
that
the
other

despit

more
emot
in

final
scene
than
mani
of
the
tear-jerk
foist
on

.

power
stuff
.

segment
eight
bring
a
whole
new
mean
to
the
clich√©
``
save

.

set
to

``

everyth
seem

when
the

In

some
amaz
anim
is
present
here
,
and
well
worth
the
ten
dollar
a
ticket
alon
-lrb-
although
brush
stroke
are
evid
in
one
scene
due
to
the
enlarg
of
the
film
-rrb-
.

the
host
segment
are
larg
-lrb-
no
pun
intend
-rrb-
throwaway
,
although
steve
martin
's
clip
is
pretti
funni
.

Be
sure
to
stay
through
the
credit
for
a
littl
more
humor
from
martin
.

penn
and
teller
are
usual
funni
,
but
here
their
gag
seem
routin
and
therefor
uninterest
.

the
best
segment
come
from
,
of
all
peopl
,
bett
midler
,
who
get
to
tell
us
about
some
of
the
abandon
segment
that
never
made
it
off
of
the
draw
board
.

piec
like
flight
of
the
bumblebe
,
a
take
on
the
four
horsemen
set
to
wagner
's
``
ride
of
the
valkyri
''
,
and
a
strang
segment
prepar
in
the
'40
by
salvador
dali
that
never
wa
shown
are
all
preview
here
and
teas
that
they
may
appear
in
futur
instal
.

for
fan
of
visual
stimul
or
classic
music
,
fantasia
2000
is
a
perfect
way
to
spend
the
afternoon
.

the
film
is
also
decent
famili
entertain
and
contain
littl
to
no
objection
materi
.

As
I
mention
earlier
in
the
review
,
if
ten
dollar
seem
like
too
much
for
you
to
spend
on
thi
film
,
fear
not
becaus
after
it
run
in
imax
theater
it
is
go
to
be
brought
out
in
regular
theater
.

I
must
stress
that
the
best
way
to
see
thi
film
is
on
an
imax
screen
though
.

then
you
too
can
believ
that
whales/triangl
things/sprit
can
fli
.
