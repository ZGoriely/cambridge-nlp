and
robert
duval
as
memphi
'
former
mentor
is
just

also
,
I
'm
a
big
fan
of
will
patton
-lrb-
armageddon
,
the
postman
-rrb-
and
would
love
to
see
him
get
a
huge
role
someday
.

none
of
these
three
perform
are
given
much
to
do
unfortun
.

some
underr
perform
howev
are
given
meati
support

in
pursuit
of
memphi
,
as
doe
timothi
olyph
-lrb-
Go
-rrb-
as
lindo
's
partner
.

I
just
wish
some
of
the
other
charact
could
have
been
as
import
.

the
onli
real
gripe
I
have
about
the
film
though
is
it
conclus
...
mainli
becaus
you
know
how
it
will
end
befor
the
open
credit
even
roll
.

there
's
no
doubt
in
anyon
's
mind
that
the
50
car
will
be
success
stolen
,
and
the
filmmak
blew
a
perfectli
good
opportun
to
add
some
suspens
to
the
pictur
by
use
the
``
rival
car
thief
''
plot
line
.

As
it
stand
,
that
stori
line
is
wrap
up
about
halfway
through
the
film
in
a
tidi
littl
packag
.

but
if
I
wa
make
thi
film
,
I
'd
have
had
the
rival
gang
tri
to
get
to
the
car
befor
memphi
and
hi
crew
,
therebi
make
memphi
have
to
improvis
...
therebi
ad
some
meat
to
the
plot
.

the
final
is
essenti
just
a
big
car
chase
,
and
there
just
are
n't
way
to
make
car
chase
interest
anymor
.

It
's
all
been
done
.

the
chase
is
also
shot
and
edit
in
that
``
jerri
bruckheim
action
sequenc
''
kind
of
way
that
leav
the
audienc
wonder
what
specif
is
go
on
in
the
scene
.

sure
it
's
a
car
chase
,
but
what
exactli
are
the
particular
of
it
?

It
's
veri
hard
to
tell
.

final
,
there
's
a
stunt
dure
thi
scene
that
come
close
to
challeng
the
``
bu
jump
the
ramp
''
sequenc
from
speed
in
the
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
think
so
...
''
depart
.

despit
those
minor
complaint
,
gone
in
sixti
second
is
pure
summer
movi
entertain
.

It
's
not
thought
provok
,
but
it
's
shini
,
loud
and
fun
...
just
what
a
summer
flick
should
be
.
