and
``
a
breakthrough
''
and
more
.

and

of
hi
butt
to
entertain
us
;
that
he
can
be
as
dramat
as
ani
of
hollywood

men
.

the
film
ha
a
difficult
premis
to
tackl
,
tri
to
set

televis
show
,
you
get
the
sens
that
you
are

and
the
way
the

would
in
the
``

''
truman
show
is
clever
and
well-don

is
the
first
oscar-worthi

borrow
a
line
from

be
abl
to
top
hi
role
