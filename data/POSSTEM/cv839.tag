doe

escap
hi
charact
as
chandler
on
the
alreadi
classic
t.v.
comedi
``
friend
,
''
as
both
oscar
novak
and
chandler
are
clueless
,
shi
,
and
sensit
.

nonetheless
,
perri
is
hilari
here
,
and
show
that
he
can
handl
drama
,
as
obvious
,
hi
charact
suffer
quit
a
bit
here
.

It
's
wonder
to
see
neve
campbel
outsid
of
a
horror
movi
,
-lrb-
she
wa
the
star
of
screamand
2
,
and
the
upcom
scream
3
-rrb-
as
she
handl
comedi
superbl
here
.

her
voic
,
smile
,
and
person
are
more
than
perfect
for
romant
comedies-stay
with
thi
genr
,
neve
.

neve
is
delight
as
her
conflict
charact
,
who
feel
love
for
oscar
,
but
know
,
base
on
rumor
,
that
he
is
gay
.

As
usual
,
campbel
is
likabl
as
her
likabl
charact
.

unlik
the
other
two
lead
here
,
dylan
mcdermott
is
flat
in
hi
dialogu
,
and
is
never
convinc
.

when
hi
charact
hi
present
,
mcdermott
set
a
dull
tone
to
the
scene
with
hi
horribl
act
.

stick
to
the
t.v.
drama
,
the
practic
,
dylan
.

the
major
weak
spot
in
three
To
tango
is
the
direct
of
damon
santostefano
.

No
origin
or
techniqu
is
use
whatsoev
.

three
To
tango
is
lucki
that
the
script
is
so
edgi
and
that
perri
and
campbel
are
wonder
in
comedi
,
or
els
the
film
would
have
been
a
disast
,
as
it
is
just
plain
bore
to
look
at
.

three
To
tango
is
a
film
done
mani
time
befor
,
as
the
plot
is
suspici
close
to
1998
's
the
object
of
My
affect
,
but
the
plot
ha
never
been
complet
so
well
.

three
To
tango
's
script
,
written
by
rodney
patrick
vaccaro
and
alin
brosh
mckenna
is
fun
,
fast
,
and
funni
,
deliv
not
onli
origin
,
hilari
gay
joke
-lrb-
not
your
run
of
the
mill
materi
-rrb-
,
but
a
certain
snappi
in
the
dialogu
between
charact
that
alway
keep
you
smile
.

unlik
last
summer
's
south
park
:
bigger
,
longer
,
and
uncut
and
1997
's
In
&
out
,
three
To
tango
is
a
comedi
in
which
the
gay
element
is
not
crude
or
vulgar
.

the
script
is
wise
to
take
thi
rout
,
as
gay
ca
n't
-lrb-
I
do
n't
think
so
,
anyway
-rrb-
be
offend
by
thi
light
,
play
comedi
.

-lrb-
To
prove
thi
,
a
gay
coupl
wa
in
the
audienc
who
were
laugh
constantli
.
-rrb-

three
To
tango
's
climax
is
a
hilari
,
clever
scene
that
is
pure
ironi
base
on
the
outcom
of
most
romantic-mistaken
ident
comedi
.

three
To
tango
is
a
gem
.

the
bottom
line
:
three
To
tango
is
a
light
,
sharp
,
snappi
romant
comedi
with
a
superb
end
,
and
great
star
.

one
of
the
better
romant
comedi
of
1999
.
