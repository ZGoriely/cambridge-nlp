timefram
for

is
in

but
the
atmospher

Of

noth

tender
?

In
a
quentin
tarantino
film
?

sure
,
there
've
been
moment
of
sweet
in
hi
prior
film
--
the
affection
exchang
between
the
bruce
willi
and
maria
de
madeiro
charact
in
pulp
fiction
and
the
unflag
dedic
share
by
the
charact
of
tim
roth
and
amanda
plummer
,
or
even
in
reservoir
dog
,
where
a
deep
,
unspoken
bond
develop
between
the
harvey
keitel
and
tim
roth
charact
--
but
for
the
most
part
,
mr.
tarantino
's
film
are
typifi
by
manic
energi
,
unexpect
outburst
of
violenc
,
and
clever
,
often
wordi
,
banter
.

these
stapl
of
hi
work
are
all
present
in
jacki
brown
,
but
what
's
new
here
is
a
differ
facet
of
hi
storytel
--
a
willing
to
imbu
the
film
with
a
poignant
emot
undercurr
,
and
a
patienc
to
draw
out
sever
scene
with
great
deliber
.

thi
effect
demonstr
of
rang
prohibit
the
pigeonhol
of
mr.
tarantino
as
simpli
a
helmer
of
slick
,
hip
crime
drama
with
fast-talk
lowlif
,
and
herald
him
as
a
bonafid
multifacet
talent
;
he
's
the
real
deal
.

thi
new
aspect
of
mr.
tarantino
's
storytel
is
probabl
best
embodi
in
a
singl
charact
--
that
of
the
world-weari
,
sensit
,
and
exceedingly-profession
max
cherri
,
whose
unspoken
attract
to
jacki
is
touch
.

mr.
forster
's
nuanc
,
underst
perform
is
the
best
in
the
film
;
he
creat
an
amiabl
charact
of
such
poignanc
that
when
he
gaze
at
jacki
,
we
smile
along
with
him
.

much
press
ha
been
given
about
the
cast
of
blaxploitation-era
icon
pam
grier
in
the
lead
,
with
the
wag
buzz
that
mr.
tarantino
may
do
for
her
what
hi
pulp
fiction
did
to
bolster
john
travolta
's
then-sag
career
.

As
it
turn
out
,
ms.
grier
is
solid
in
the
film
's
titl
role
,
although
noth
here
forc
her
to
test
her
rang
.

I
do
have
to
take
except
to
the
claim
that
thi
film
mark
her
career
resurrect
,
though
--
she
's
been
work
steadili
over
the
year
,
often
in
direct-to-video
action
flick
,
but
also
in
such
recent
theatric
releas
as
tim
burton
's
mar
attack
!

and
larri
cohen
's
origin
gangsta
-lrb-
where
she
first
team
up
with
mr.
forster
.
-rrb-

Of
cours
,
it
's
true
that
her
role
here
wa
a
godsend
--
a
meati
a
part
as
thi
is
rariti
for

ani

actress
,
let
alon
one
of
her
age
and
current
statu

the
industri
.

while
jacki
brown
may
disappoint
those
look
for
anoth
pulp
fiction
clone
,
it
mark
tremend
growth
of
mr.
tarantino
as
a
director
whose
horizon
are
rapidli
expand

and
whose
character
have
never
been
better
.

and
while
the

a

of
155

it
