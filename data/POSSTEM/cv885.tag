or
that
silli

from

-rrb-
demonstr
,
the
thrill
and
geniu
are
gone
.

I
'm
not
sure
the
dark
crystal
,
made
today
,
would
gener
from
an
audienc
of
kid
five
to
fifti
the
same
awe-fil
respons
.

An
all-pow
crystal
ha
crack
,
caus
the
leader
of
the
green
world
to
split
apart
into
two
be
:
the
big
,
gentl
mystic
,
and
the
vulture-lik
skeksi
.

the
mystic
send
jen
,
a
naiv
gelfl

,
on
a
mission
to
find
the
shard
that
crack
away
,
which
must

into

befor
the

,
befor
the
great
``

of

along
the
way
,
jen
encount
and
team
up
with
the
onli

gelfl

the

an

her

and
a

.

much
of
the
beauti
in
the
dark
crystal
,
which
is
a
simpl
tale
-lrb-
though
it
doe
not
condescend
to
ani
viewer
-rrb-
,
lie
in
it
art
direct
and
creatur
design
.

the
puppet
is
phenomen
--
observ
the
scene
in
which
jen
play
hi
flute
,
or
the
landwalk
chase
--
but
I
must
stress
that
ani
thought
of
string
and
hand
and
remot
control
all
but
vanish
in
the
open
moment
of
the
pictur
,
a
delicately-narr
-lrb-
by
john

-rrb-
,
absorb
prologu
.

the
voic
work
in
the
film
,
by
muppet
regular
and
irregular
,
is
tone-perfect
.

As
well
,
trevor
jone
'
score
should
not
be
discount
:
it
contribut
to
the
film
almost
as
an
unseen
charact
.

I
suppos
,
due
to
the
complex
involv
in
execut
a
movi
of
thi
natur
,
that
it
could
n't
be
help
,
but
I
wish
the
film
wa
longer
.

jen
and
kira
have
wonder
...
well
,
chemistri
,
and
more
scene
of
them
quietli
convers
would
have
been
appreci
.

the
dark
crystal
ha
a
veri
small
cult
follow
.

the
weaker
labyrinth
is
probabl
better-known
,
which
is
upset
.

A
friend
of
mine
relat
a
stori
to
me
that
henson
wa
pressur
into
plant
human
among
labyrinth
's
creatur
due
to
the
financi
failur
of
people-less
the
dark
crystal
.

that
film
never
quit
found
it
foot
;
it
play
like
an
acid-trip
episod
of
``
the
muppet
show
''
with
david
bowi
as
guest-host
,
borrow
from
tolkien
and
pander
to
tolkien
's
fan-bas
.

-lrb-
I
suppos
I
just
made
labyrinth
sound
appet
to
a
certain
sector
of
the
public
.
-rrb-

the
dark
crystal
deserv
-lrb-
and
still
deserv
-rrb-
a
bigger
audienc
.

It
's
the
best
kind
of
children
's
entertain
:
eleg
,
fantast
,
and
courag
un-hip
