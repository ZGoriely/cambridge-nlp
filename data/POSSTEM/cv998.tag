miracl
.

for
about
160
out
of
it
170
minut
,
``
save
privat
ryan
''
is
flawless
.

liter
.

the
plot
is
simpl
enough
.

after
the
epic
d-day
invas
-lrb-
whose
sequenc
are

pvt.
jame
ryan

damon

,
whose
brother
have
all
die
in

.

onc
they
find
him
,
they
are
to
bring
him
back
for
immedi
discharg
so
that
he
can
go
home
.

accompani
miller
are
hi
crew
,
play
with
astonish
perfect
by
a
group
of
charact
actor
that
are
simpli
sensat
.

barri
pepper
,
adam
goldberg
,
vin
diesel
,
giovanni
ribisi
,
davi
,
and
burn
are
the
team
sent
to
find
one
man
,
and
bring
him
home
.

the
battl
sequenc
that
bookend
the
film
are
extraordinari
.

liter
.

there
is
noth
in
film
that
ha
ever
been
record
that
will
prepar
you
for
the
sheer
onslaught
of
terror
violenc
in
the
film
's
first
20
minut
.

spielberg
film
almost
the
entir
movi
without
music
,
leav
it
up
to
the
charact
to
gener
emot
,
and
they
do
to
perfect
.

the
sequenc
in
franc
,
all
of
them
,
begin
with
the
battl
and
end
with
the
battl
,
are
fabul
,
especi
the
dialogu
between
the
men
as
they
walk
through
the
hill
and
countrysid
,
tri
to
save
privat
ryan
.

there
are
no
word
I
can
use
to
describ
the
true
horror
and
power
of
these
sequenc
.

thi
is
what
coppola
wa
look
for
in
``
apocalyps
now
''
,
but
could
n't
creat
.

the
sheer
horror
of
these
sequenc
all
but
condemn
war
.

the
perform
by
hank
as
the
leader
of
thi
gang
is
also
extraordinari
.

He
is
head
and
shoulder
abov
of
the
rest
of
the
actor
in
the
world
,
with
hi
comic
time
,
dramat
flair
,
hi
quiet
emot
that
stir
an
entir
nation
to
tear
.

hank
is
thi
countri
's
finest
actor
,
and
he
prove
it
here
.

howev
,
spielberg
almost
destroy
hi
own
masterpiec
.

with
a
chanc
to
make
it
the
one
of
the
greatest
film
of
all
time
,
spielberg
creat
10
minut
of
pure
worthless
film
.

the
sequenc
involv
armi
chief-of-stafff
georg
marshal
and
mrs.
ryan
is
decent
,
but
doe
n't
hold
up
to
the
rest
of
the
film
,
reli
on
wartim
clich
to
power
it
.

but
that
is
forgiv
.

what
is
n't
is
the
bookend
of
the
film
,
the
cemetari
sequenc
.

the
first
one
is
quit
good
,
a
decent
introduct
into
the
live
of
these
men
.

the
last
sequenc
is
atroci
.

the
forc
emot
,
accompani
by
a
ridicul
piec
of
music
,
is
simpli
horribl
compar
to
the
rest
of
the
magic
film
.

these
flaw
are
what
downgrad
``
ryan
''
from
the
greatest
film
of
our
era
,
to
the
greatest
war
film
of
our
era
.

spielberg
should
have
trust
hi
own
materi
,
and
he
should
have
trust
hank
to
deliv
the
most
chill
line
of
the
movi
,
to
end
hi
masterpiec
right
there
.

the
use
of
the
flag
,
though
patriot
,
is
in
contrast
to
the
movi
's
theme
.

the
power
of
the
bulk
of
the
film
,
howev
,
is
astonish
.

spielberg
ha
truli
made
a
wondrou
work
of
art
,
that
persist
even
after
first
view
of
the
film
,
is
extraordinari
.

thi
is
the
film
of
the
year
.
