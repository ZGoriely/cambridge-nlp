is
one
of
``
those

movi
.

the
kind
of
movi
which
serv
no
purpos
except
to

.

It
doe
not
ask
us
to
think
about
import
question
like
life
on
other
planet
or
the
possibl
that
there
is
no
god
...
screw

say
boldli
,
let
's
see
some
comput
gener
monster
rip
into

decapit
and
gener
caus
irrepar
booboo
to
a

care
to
leav
your
brain
at
the
door
...
but
bring

sens
of
humor
and
excit
in
with
you
.

the
act
is
decent
,
the
effect
top
rate
.

to
best
describ
it
?

put
togeth
the
jet
ski
scene
from

where
you
keep
scream
``

behind
you
''
and
you
end
up
with
deep
