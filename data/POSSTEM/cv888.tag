that
.

with
hi
new
film
,
scott
ha
return

to
the
fascin
age
of
the
ancient
roman
empir
.

and
like
those
preced

and
ben
hur
,
gladiat
ha
nearli
everyth
go
for
it-a
strong
lead
actor
,
a
wonder
support
cast
,
eye-catch
special
effect
,
and
a
great
script
.

sinc
the
two
aforement
film
came
out
befor
the
prime
target
viewer
of
gladiat
-lrb-
teenag
to
thirty-year-old
male
-rrb-
were
around
,
a
whole
new
genr
may
just
be
reborn
and
revisit
.

from
a
weak
begin
,
the
film
start
off
extrem
gloomi
and
inauspici
.

rome
's
best
gener
maximu
-lrb-
russel

-rrb-
,
who
ha

the
empir

in
the
year
180
a.d.
that
is
-rrb-
wage
a
war
against
germania
.

scott
shoot
the
gori
battl
in
an
awkward
style
,
similar
to
that
of
save
privat
ryan
but
much
less
effect
.

It
's
blurri
,
in
slow
motion
,
and
the
sound
is
mute
.

As
soon
as
thi
artist
method
began
,
it
wa
hard
to
tell
what
wa
what
and
who
wa
who
.

It
's
a
good
thing
scott
stop
thi
after
the
first
twenti
minut
or
els
gladiat
would
have
been
tortur
to
watch
.

instead
,
the
gener
swear
he
will
get
out
after
thi
battl
.

He
want
to
go
back
to
hi
famili
and
hi
crop
,
he
want
a
quiet
life
.

but
,
unexpectedli
,
he
get
anyth
but
that
.

the
die
emperor
of
rome
,
marcu
aureliu
-lrb-
richard
harri
-rrb-
,
decid
to
have
maximu
appoint
new
emperor
of
rome
onc
he
die
.

He
ask
maximu
to
restor
the
republ
by
give
more
power
to
the
senat
.

all
of
thi
doe
not
go
well
for
aureliu

son
,
commodu
-lrb-
joaquin
phoenix
-rrb-
who
wa
expect
hi

jealou
and
upset
,
commodu
kill
hi
own
father
,
name
himself
emperor
,
kill
maximu
'
wife
and
son
,
and
attempt
to
kill

but
maximu
is
abl
to
escap
hi
own
death
and
vow
to
kill
commodu
and
fulfil
marcu
aureliu

wish
.

now
a

the
onli
way
he
can
win
hi
own
freedom
and
complet
hi

is
to
becom

gladiat
,
who
eventu
are
releas
for
their
success
.

A
stori
of
betray
and
promis
,
gladiat
is
more
than
just
a
mindless
action
flick
.

you
actual
care
about
the
charact
,
sometim
even
the
evil
villain
commodu
,
who
is
just
a
young
man
as
determin
to
make
rome
one
way
as
maximu
is
determin
to
make
it
the
other
way
.

phoenix
play
hi
charact
brilliantli
.

think
of
commodu
as
the
perci
wetmor
-lrb-
of
pant-wett
the
green
mile
-rrb-
of
the
roman
empire-a
whini
,
sleazi
,
``
respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man
''
brat
who
hate
when
he
's
not
the
center
of
attent
.

everi
scene
we
see
commodu
,
he
's
either
cri
or
he
look
like
he
ha
just
been
cri
.

phoenix
ha
definit
matur
as
an
actor
sinc
To
die
for
,
and
gladiat
show
he
's
more
than
just
river
's
littl
brother
.

crow
is
also
excel
as
the
film
's
grisly-fac
hero
.

maximu
is
one
of
the
few
charact
in
recent
cinema
who
actual
ha
emot
.

thi
guy
actual
act
like
a
anyon
in
hi
situat
would
act
,
he
's
no
invinc
superhero
who
onli
blurt
out
one-lin
,
he
-lrb-
believ
it
or
not
-rrb-
act
like
a
human
be
!

the
rest
of
the
cast
,
includ
richard
harri
,
djimon
hounsou
,
walter
hill
,
derek
jacobi
,
and
conni
nielsen
are
also
first
rate
.

ridley
scott
,
use
outstand
special
effect
,
ha
brilliantli
recreat
the
roman
coliseum
,
the
loud
of
the
roman
mob
,
and
the
citi
of
rome
in
gener
.

the
visual
are
breathtak
and
volumin
,
like
a
cleopatra
of
the
year
2000
.

the
costum
is
also
wonder
from
the
detail
shield
and
armor
to
the
exquisit
dress
of
the
upper-class
politician
.

gladiat
is
anoth
movi
you
have
to
see
on
the
big
screen
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
experi
.

along
with
u-571
,
action
fan
should
have
plenti
to
see
in
theater
thi
week
and
should
expect
much
more
excit
to
come
thi
summer
of
2000
.
