black

featur
a
lot
of
sex
between
black

and
young
white

while
the
film
wa
trim
down
to
a
tamer
R
rate
,
viewer
will
wonder
what
could
be
more
explicit
than
what
they
are

.

the
three-way
sexual
begin
of
the
film
nice
warn
viewer
of
what
they
are
in
for
,
and
sever
audienc
member
got
up
and
left
at
that
point
.

the
frequent
sex
is
one
of
the
film
's
few
flaw
as
the
titil
is
overdon
and
at
time
complet
unrel
to
anyth
els
go
on
in
the
film
.

To
toback
's
credit
,
the
level
of
violenc
in
black
&
white
is
almost
nil
.

these
gangsta
and
hip-hop
artist
are
given
real
problem
and
concern
,
and
onli
becom
gun-tot
crazi
when
it
benefit
them
to
appear
that
way
.

whenev
a
charact
find
himself
on
donag
's
handheld
digit
camera
,
he
start
spout
off
righteou
tirad
on
america
and
proclaim
hi
independ
,
but
not
everyon
ha
fulli
bought
into
the
idea
.

charli
-lrb-
phillip
-rrb-
is
full
of
bluster
about
whi
she
love
hip-hop
,
but
admit
that
``
in
ten
year
time
,
I
'll
be
way
over
thi
.
''

these
youth
know
they
are
go
through
a
phase
,
and
are
simpli
enjoy
it
.

toback
fill
the
space
between
these
tirad
with
scene
that
are
lightweight
and
funni
.

most
of
the
humour
come
from
mike
tyson
,
who
provid
the
film
's
comic
relief
without
realli
tri
.

He
is
given
big
word
like
vernacular
to
say
,
and
as
rich
tri
to
discuss
a
particular
street
problem
with
tyson
,
he
frequent
ha
to
ask
him
to
use
smaller
word
and
explain
himself
better
,
play
on
tyson
's
imag
as
a
dimwit
.

but
tyson
also
get
the
film
's
scariest
moment
.

As
he
is
mercilessli
hit
upon
by
the
veri
gay
terri
,
tyson
is
a
marvel
to
watch
as
he
fight
to
remain
calm
.

the
scene
is
entir
improvis
,
with
downey
jr.
be
told
to
just
keep
at
tyson
until
he
get
a
reaction
.

the
reaction
he
get
,
be
slap
and
then
choke
is
astonish
,
as
downey
Jr
's
face
turn
a
frighten
shade
of
purpl
.

black
&
white
is
a
film
about
hip-hop
cultur
,
and
the
film
's
omnipres
hip-hop
soundtrack

support

.

but
toback
keep

from

too
seriou
;
by
move
from

toback
just
want

to
have

along
the
way

and
we
