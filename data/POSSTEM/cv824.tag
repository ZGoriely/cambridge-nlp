hi
way
out
of
a
jam
with
a
computer-gener
jabba
the
hutt
,
do
n't
do
much
but
call
attent
to
themselv
.

other
than
these
,
the
film
is
exactli
the
same
.

whi
pay
to
see
it
in
the
theater
,
you
might
ask
?

simpli
becaus
when
thi
movi
wa
releas
,
most
of
us
were
a
few
year
short
of
be
born
.

We
should
all
get
up
and
go
to
the
movi
for
the
experi
,
especi
if
you
have
n't
seen
it
.

the
plot
is
basic
but
in
the
same
way
,
complex
.

It
ha
mani
theme
,
but
the
one
rotat
around
luke
skywalk
-lrb-
mark
hamil
-rrb-
and
hi
quest
to
becom
a
jedi
knight
.

hi
mission
begin
when
a
droid
name
r2-d2
play
back
a
secret
messag
record
by
the
beauti
princess
leia
-lrb-
carri
fisher
-rrb-
,
which
tell
him
to
contact
the
mysteri
obi-wan
kanobi
-lrb-
alec
guiness
-rrb-
.

He
and
kanobi
then
,
join
by
two
inter-galact
renegad
,
han
solo
-lrb-
harrison
ford
-rrb-
and
chewbacca
,
and
skywalk
's
two
droid
D2
and
c3po
-lrb-
the
voic
of
anthoni
edward
-rrb-
,
wage
war
upon
the
corrupt
empir
,
command
by
an
evil
gener
-lrb-
peter
cush
-rrb-
and
the
traitor
darth
vader
-lrb-
the
voic
of
jame
earl
jone
-rrb-
.

skywalk
defeat
the
evil
empir
by
rise
out
of
himself
to
embrac
someth
larger
:
the
forc
.

the
film
is
obvious
quit
star-stud
.

but
how
wa
luca
to
know
that
ford
would
becom
one
of
the
most
sought
after
men
in
hollywood
and
jone
'
voic
would
appear
so
mani
more
time
in
the
futur
?

It
just
happen
to
work
out
for
him
.

the
magic
of
star
war
lie
in
the
way
that
skywalk
's
triumph
is
symbol
by
the
audienc
's
sens
of
becom
someth
larger
than
life
itself-a
univers
of
fan
,
young
and
old
,
recreat
a
movi
atmospher
that
will
impress
gener
