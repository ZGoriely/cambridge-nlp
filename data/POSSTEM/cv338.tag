anoth
great
thing
about
the
film
wa
the
perform
of
harold
perrineau
as
romeo
's
best
friend
.

mercutio

who
in

a

nurs
,
even
though
she
wa
never
given

she

now

the

now
rival

and
their
small

one
slight
problem
with
the
film

the
difficulti
to

sub-titl
could
have
help
in

toward
the
end
,
it
becam
easier
to
understand
.

thi
excel
movi
pose
anoth
prob-lem
:
what
genr
is
it
?

romeo
&
juliet
contain
so
much
drama
,
yet
enough
comedi
and
action
to
be
place
in
either
of
those
categori
.

with
the
same
award-win
formula
that
wa
use
by
quentin
tarantino
in
reservoir

,
romeo
&
juliet
is
a
sure
fire
modern
masterpiec
