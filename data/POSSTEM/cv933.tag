they
offer
him
anoth
life
,
as
a
celebr
--
a
toy
in
a

in

.

He
is
now
forc

a
littl
while
-lrb-
befor
he
grow
up
-rrb-
and
be
forgotten
,
or
be
admir
by
children
for
gener
.

the
problem
is
,
if
woodi
escap
from
Al
's
clutch
and
return
home
,
they
will
end
up
back
in
the
lone
dark
of
storag
.

A
real
effort
is
made
in
the
technic
depart
.

the
anim
is
rich
and
color
,
with
lot
of
wonder
detail
.

the
``
cinematographi
''
is
also
extrem
improv
sinc
toy
stori
;
there
are
a
lot
of
complic
swing
,
turn
and
close-up
that
realli
make
an
impress
.

light
and
filter
are
use
to
creat
a
mood
-lrb-
as
in
a
surprisingli
emot
moment-jessi
's
remembr
of
her
day
when
she
wa
a
belov
toy
-rrb-
the
film
contain
a
lot
of
in-sid
joke
-lrb-
such
as
the
one
about
videogam
-rrb-
,
and
entertain
parodi
on
``
jurass
park
''
and
``
star
war
''
.

the
film
end
with
the
``
fail
take
''
,
the
kind
of
scene
that
we
are
use
to
see
after
comedi
show
on
TV
.

these
outtak
are
some
of
the
funniest
scene
in
the
film
.

but
what
in
the
end
make
``
toy
stori
2
''
a
memor
experi
is
not
the
joke
,
it
multipl
parodi
or
marvel
anim
.

It
is
it
heart
and
emot
--
the
stori
about
the
mean
of
friendship
,
love
and
even
life
itself
.

It
is
not
difficult
to
predict
that
``
toy
stori
2
''
would
be
a
huge
econom
success
,
but
it
artist
achiev
wa
unexpect
.

unexpect
becaus
the
first
film
wa
n't
much
more
than
a
demonstr
of
special
effect
.

but
mostli
it
wa
unexpect
becaus
disney
ha
n't
produc
anyth
spectacular
in
year
and
is
constantli
surpass
by
compani
such
as
dreamwork
and
warner
br
.

but
here
the
director
ha
chang
the
atmospher
of
the
film
,
make
it
more
access
and
interest
for
person
older
that
9
year
.

thi
is
a
big
step-away
from
the
ancient
law
of
disney-anim
.

off
cours
,
thi
is
not
``
antz
''
,
it
is
not
as
intellig
;
thi
is
not
a
landmark
and
no
masterpiec
,
but
I
promis
that
you
'll
find
it
as
funni
and
enjoy
as
I
have
.

whether
thi
is
the
best
anim
film
of
the
year
,
I
dare
not
say
.

My
choic
would
probabl
be
``
the
iron
giant
''
,
but
-lrb-
along
side
with
``
american
pie
''
-rrb-
thi
is
the
comedi
of
the
year
.

I
almost
lost
my
hope
for
disney
,
but
``
toy
stori
2
''
prove
that
disney
ha
n't
lost
their
abil
to
entertain
.
