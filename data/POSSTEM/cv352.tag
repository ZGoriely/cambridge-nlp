the
plot
unfold
at
a
rapid
pace
explain
itself
through
great
action
,
special
effect
,
and
twist
after
mind-boggl
twist
.

It
grab
you
and
never
let
go
!

thi
film
is
a
winner
from
begin
to
end
.

the
plot
is
superb
;
combin
the
best
element
of
scienc
fiction
and
psycholog
mysteri
to
creat
a
rip-roar
saga
.

schwarzenegg
give
hi
best
perform
ever
,
and
the
support
cast
is
good
too
.

the
action
and
stunt
are
terrif
.

the
set
are
huge
and
elabor
with
a
lot
of
attent
pay
to
detail
.

the
music
and
sound
effect
are
perfect
for
the
film
and
realli
add
a
certain
level
of
impact
to
the
action
.

the
make-up
effect
by
rob
bottin
-lrb-
the
howl
,
the
thing
,
and
robocop
-rrb-
are
top
notch
,
not
to
mention
extrem
outlandish
.

the
visual
effect
by
dream
quest
-lrb-
the
abyss
-rrb-
and
industri
light
and
magic
-lrb-
star
war
trilog
,
jurass
park
,
and
termin
2
-rrb-
are
phenomen
!

the
visual
had
such
a
state
of
the
art
``
slick
''
that
they
won
an
oscar
.

Of
cours
the
film
is
n't
alway
realist
;
it
's
more
fiction
than
scienc
.

for
exampl
,
it
is
true
that
a
bodi
wo
n't
explod
in
the
vacuum
of
space
but
in
total
recal
they
do
.

who
care
?

It
's
a
movi
.

movi
are
suppos
to
entertain
.

and
in
my
opinion
thi
film
achiev
an
entertain
level
in
film
that
is
so
terrif
,
it
may
be
imposs
to
beat
.
