there
are
some
work
of
art
that
are
almost
imposs
to
review
,
not
becaus
of
their
own
complex
,
but
becaus
of
their
legendari
statu
which
prevent
the
review
to
say
anyth
origin
.

one
of
such
masterpiec
is
casablanca
,
probabl
not
the
best
film
in
the
histori
of
the
seventh
art
,
but
definit
the
most
popular
one
.

it
popular
can
be
measur
not
in
a
multitud
of
more
or
less
disguis
remak
that
were
made
in
more
than
half
a
centuri
sinc
it
premier
,
but
also
in
countless
tribut
and
refer
that
movi
maker
use
in
their
work
to
thi
day
.

casablanca
is
also
a
movi
that
ha
the
veri
rare
virtu
of
both
be
prais
by
the
critic
and
love
by
gener
audienc
.

one
of
the
thing
that
make
thi
film
even
more
uniqu
wa
the
fact
that
it
wa
doom
to
fail
,
at
least
judg
by
convent
movie-mak
wisdom
of
it
time
.

It
wa
base
on
a
broadway
play
so
mediocr
that
it
had
n't
been
produc
on
stage
;
screenplay
by
three
writers-juliu
G.
epstein
,
philip
J.
epstein
and
howard
koch-wa
bee
written
as
shoot
went
along
;
the
main

second
choic
,
and
,
final
,
man

camera
,
michael
curtiz
wa
consid
to
be
capabl
,
but
not
great
director
.

howev
,
the
movi
wa
commerci
success
and
earn
three
``
oscar
''
,
includ
the
one
for
the
best
film
.

until
thi
veri
day
,
it
is
consid
to
be
the
best
exampl
of
hollywood
film-mak
in
it
own
golden
age
.

the
plot
of
the
movi
wa
heavili
influenc
by
the
need
of
ww2
propaganda
,
yet
it
also
use
rather
complic
and
now
almost
forgotten
polit
circumst
of
that
global
conflict
in
order
to
make
intrigu
stori
.

In
decemb
1941
,
casablanca
,
exot
port
on
the
atlant
coast
of
north
africa
is
control
by
offici
neutral

yet
nazi-collabor

thousand

from

europ
are
stuck
there
on
the
way
to
lisbon
and
safeti
of
america
,
and
readi
to
pay
ani
price
for
preciou

their
miseri

.

hi
best
friend
is
rick
blain
-lrb-
bogart
-rrb-
,
who
use
to
be
idealist
anti-fascist
,
and
now
own
popular
night
club
in
casablanca
and
live
by
hi
own
cynic
philosophi
of
``
stick
hi
neck
for
nobodi
''
.

howev
,
everyth
chang
when
he
get
in
possess
of
two
preciou
extra
visa
.

thi
event
coincid
with
the
arriv
of
two
new
refuge
to
casablanca
.

one
of
them
is
victor
laszlo
-lrb-
henreid
-rrb-
,
czech
resist
leader
who
escap
three
time
from
nazi
concentr
camp
and
becam
the
legend
of
enslav
europ
.

He
is
accompani
by
hi
beauti
wife
ilsa
lund
-lrb-
bergman
-rrb-
,
with
whom
rick
had
a
stormi
affair
in
the
eve
of
nazi
occup
of
pari
.

the
coupl
need
visa
,
especi
becaus
of
the
gestapo
major
strasser
-lrb-
veidt
-rrb-
be
on
their
trail
.

rick
is
now
forc
to
choos
between
love
,
wound
pride
,
self-preserv
interest
and
hi
own
hatr
of
fascism
.

the
cast
for
thi
movi
seem
influenc
by
divin
inspiration-humphrey
bogart
,
most
legendari
actor
in
the
histori
of
cinema
,
is
one
of
the
rare
charact
actor
who
elev
hi
persona
to
the
star
statu
.

bogart
's
portray
of
rick
as
complic
man
,
torn
between
idealist
past
and
bitter
present
,
wa
so
perfect
,
that
hi
icon
would
forev
be
connect
with
that
charact
.

anoth
icon
in
hi
compani
is
ingrid
bergman
,
great
actress
of
old
hollywood
,
here
in
her
artist
and
visual
prime
.

the
cinemat
coupl
of
bogart
and
bergman
becam
one
of
the
main
symbol
of
that
era
of
filmmaking-som
happier
time
when
the
romanc
on
the
screen
did
n't
look
childish
nor
trite
like
in
some
more
contemporari
work
.

for
mani
peopl
,
casablanca
is
probabl
the
best
romant
film
ever
made
.

but
the
reason
for
that
is
n't
the
romanc
itself-it
's
the
realist
stori
of
peopl
forc
to
make
tough
,
and
often
wrong
choic
in
their
life
.

the
cast
of
casablanca
wa
right
on
target
not
just
in
a
case
of
main
lead
.

the
support
actor
also
did
a
marvel
job
.

sidney
longstreet
and
peter
lorr
were
here
mainli
to
give
a
mystic
flavour
spot
in
a
previou
bogart
classic-john
huston
's
maltes
falcon
;
yet
both
of
them
manag
to
portray
colour
and
origin
charact
.

anoth
shine
exampl
of
good
cast
is
now
almost
forgotten
paul
henreid
as
the
weakest
part
of
love
triangl
;
charact
of
victor
laszlo
ha
believ
charisma
and
look
like
a
somebodi
who
could
inspir
million
of
peopl
to
rise
against
nazi
tiranni
.

unfortun
,
the
charisma
that
burden
laszlo
,
leav
littl
place
for
difficult
choic
,
make
hi
charact
forev
overshadow
by
rick/ilsa
coupl
.

howev
,
rick
and
ilsa
actual
have
a
seriou
competiton
for
most
memor
charact
in
casablanca
.

captain
renault
,
brilliantli
portray
by
claud
rain
in
a
role
of
a
lifetim
,
wa
embodi
of
perfect
,
almost
unmatch
balanc
between
ethic
corrupt
and
physic
charm
.

despit

side
of

symbol

not

subtl

unnecessari

rain
also
gave
anoth
dimens
to
the
movi
,
make
it
even
more
ambigu
;
peopl
who

the

profession
nitpick
would
probabl
have
a
field

in
discov

histor

,
but
casablanca
is
still
a
shine
exampl
of
hollywood
ww2
movi
that
is
beliav
,
if
not
realist
.

ani
way
,
even
if
we
do
n't
see
it
as
a

,
casablanca
is
movi
that
can
be
