is
an
ordinari
stori
told

.

taken
as
a
whole
,
there
's
littl
that
's
special
about
thi

--
it
follow
a

,
leav
the
audienc
with
a
warm
,
fuzzi
feel
,
and
never
realli
challeng

but
it
's
intellig
written
-lrb-
with
dialogu
that
is
occasion
brilliant
-rrb-
,
strongli
direct
,
and
nice

So
,
while
good

is
far
from

it
's

OF
A

,
good
will
hunt
is
about
the
unlik
friendship
that
develop
between
a
world-weari
veteran
and
a
cocki
young
man
.

the
formula
for
the
two
film
is
similar
--
both
of
the
princip
learn
from
each
other
as
they
slowli
break
down
their
barrier
on
the
way
to
a
better
understand
of
life
and
their
place
in
it
--
but
the
charact
are
differ
.

Al

As

he

the

An

he

now

21

He
ha
a
short
temper
and
ani

can
set
him
off
like

unfortun

by
the
time

the

there
's
an

,

mani
of

scene
are
strong
enough
to
earn
good
will
hunt
a
recommend
,
even
if
the
overal
stori
is
somewhat
gener
.

matt
damon
,
who
recent
star
as
the
idealist
young
lawyer
in
the
rainmak
,
is
solid
-lrb-
although
not
spectacular
-rrb-
as
will
.

minni

last

-rrb-
add
anoth
strong
perform
to
a
grow
resum
-lrb-
and
it
's
refresh
that
she
wa
allow
to
keep
her
british
accent
rather
than
have
to
attempt
an
american
one
-rrb-
.

the
outstand
perform
of
the
film
belong
to
robin
william
,
whose
sean
is
sad
and
wise
,
funni
and
somber
.

arguabl
the
best
dramat
work
in
the
actor
's
career
-lrb-
alongsid
what
he
did
in
the
fisher
king
-rrb-
,
william
'
portray
could
earn
him
a
best
support
actor
oscar
nomin
.

adequ
support
is
provid
by
ben
affleck
-lrb-
chase
ami
-rrb-
and
stellan
skarsgard
-lrb-
break
the
wave
-rrb-
.

like
most
of
what
come
befor
it
,
the
end
of
good
will
hunt
is
complet
predict
.

but
meet
expect
and
follow
a
familiar
path
are
n't
alway
bad
thing
in
a
movi
,
provid
the
film
accomplish
those
goal
with
a
modicum
of
style
and
an
attent
to
detail
.

good
will
hunt
doe
both
,
and
,
as
a
result
,
earn
a
rate
commensur
with
the
``
