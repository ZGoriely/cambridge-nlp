leigh
's
perform
in
bastard
out

is
fine
,
although
she
's
not
realli
given
much
to
do
,
and

and
out
of

rage

one
can
alway
sens
that
underneath
hi
glen
is
a
pressure-cook
tick
away
.

Of
the
support
cast
,
special
note
must
be
made
of
the
crimin
underr
michael
rooker
's
perform
.

there
's
a
bit
too
much
gener
formula
in
the
screenplay
for
my
tast
,
from
the
variou
charact
spout
off
countri
bumpkin
,
to
the
familiar
sight
of
a
dried-up
uptight

on

porch

to

better
suit
for
a
stage
perform
.

still
,
it
can
not
be
deni
that
ann
meredith
's
screenplay
contain
a
wallop
of
emot
power
.

huston
's
direct
of
the
film
is
surehand
and
impress
,
give
the
film
good
pace
and
elicit
good
perform
from
her
cast
,
particularli
the
young
malon
.

her
sequenc
of
child
abus
are
shot
in
a
hard-hit
emot
,
rather
than
graphic
,
manner
,
and
are
veri
effect
.

huston
's
talent
with
camera
posit
is
wonder
,
from
a
visual
strike
shot
done
through
a
fan
,
to
an
extend
sequenc
in
the
front
seat
of
an
automobil
.

the
film
ha
the
toned-down
feel
of
a
televis
product
;
bastard
out
OF
carolina
wa
origin
compos
and
cut
for
broadcast
on
the
tnt
cabl
station
,
who
end
up
declin
the
film
due
to
sentiment
that
scene
of
abus
and
rape
in
the
film
were
too
disturbingli
realist
for
their
audienc
.

perhap
some
sequenc
of
the
film
may
be
unpleas
,
but
as
a
whole
bastard
out
OF
carolina
add
up
to
a
power
viewer
experi
worth
