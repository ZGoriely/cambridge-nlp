they
are
individu

our
abil

make

is
crucial

of

seemingly-strang
``
ritual
''
.

the
larger
struggl
is
,
of
cours
,
one
of
defin
human
.

As
the
nazi
felt
justifi
in
slaughter
jew
becaus
they
view
their
victim
as
``
sub-human
,
''
so
the
pro-slaveri
forc
of
amistad
use
a
similar
defens
.

the
abolitionist
regard
the
african
as
men
,
but
the
slaver
and
their
support
see
them
as
anim
or
properti
.

In
a
sens
,
the
moral
of
slaveri
is
on
trial
here
with
the
specter
of
civil
war
,
which
would
break
out
less
than
three
decad
later
,
loom
over
everyth
.

amistad

present
of
the
legal

polit
intricaci

the
trial
are
fascin
,
make
thi
movi
one
of
the
most
engross
courtroom
drama
in
recent
histori
.

four
claimant
come
forward
against
the
african
:
the
state
,
which
want
them
tri
for

;
the
queen
of
spain
,
who
want
them
hand
over
to

;
and
the
two
surviv
spaniard
from
La
amistad
,
who
demand
that
their
properti
be

them
.

baldwin
must
counter
all
of
these
claim
,
while
face
a
challeng
to
hi
own
preconceiv
notion
as
the
result
of

they
are
never

hi

one
point
of
differ
worth
note
between
amistad
and
schindler
'S
list
is
thi
film
's
lack
of
a
well-defin

villain

but
a

all
that
the
nazi
stood
for
.

there
is
no
such
figur
in
amistad
.

the
villain
is
slaveri
,
but
an
ideolog
,
no
matter
how
evil
,
is
rare
the
best
adversari
.

It
is
to

credit
that

without
