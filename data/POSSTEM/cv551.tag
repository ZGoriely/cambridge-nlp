soon

--
thought
that
wa
an
oxymoron
in

pictur
,
did
n't
you
?

Cy
can
not
allow
spencer
to
leav
the
cyborsuit
,
and
what
happen
when
he
need
to
urin
becom
both
sweet
and
hilari
.

the
director
's
stage
of
thi
sequenc
is
one
of
the
film
's
more
charm

.

Oh
,
and
eat

spencer
,
whose
idol
is
the
comic
book
charact
``
midknight

,
''
get
to
face
the
challeng
of
a
lifetim
when
a

come
to
captur
the

spencer

give

although
it

with

you
'll
have

It
is

PG
for

although
the
basic
cartoonish
broodwarrior
might
scare
the
littlest
kid
,
I
saw
none
of
thi
in
evid
in
our
pack
screen
,
so
I
would
say
the
show
is
fine
for
kid
five
and
up
,
and
possibl
the
younger
one
.

My
son
jeffrey
,
age
8
,
got
realli
excit
about
the

He
call
it
``
an
especi
good

.

when
I
ask
him
to
tell
me
hi

he
mention
almost
everyon
in
it
from
