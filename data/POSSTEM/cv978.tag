It
ha
been
brand
as
the
femal
version
of

that
's
probabl
a
correct
assess
of

doubl

is
base
on
an
assumpt
that
is
legal
fals
.

the
law
state
that
nobodi
can
be
convict
twice
for
the
same
crime
assum
that
it
is
the
same
crime
:
same
time
,
same
place
,
same
circumst
.

It
's
not
like
it
matter
.

thi
is
a
rollickingli
good
thriller
;
intens
,
excit
,
fast
and
furiou
.

It
's
silli
alright
,
but
thi
is
the
kind
of
film
you
just
do
n't
question
.

In
some
film
,
plausibl
is
everyth
.

doubl
jeopardi
,
howev
,
is
not
concern

make
sens
:
it
sole
purpos
is
to
entertain
,
and
it
doe
.

judd
help
the
film
tremend
in
a
difficult
role
.

thi
is
her
breakout
box-offic
perform
,
and
she
is
terrif
.

she
bring
some
emot
to
what
could
have
been
a
one-dimension
role
,
give
the
movi
a
littl
soul
to
go
along
with
it
effect
chase
scene
and

set
piec
.

tommi
lee
jone
basic
just
repris
the
role
for
which
he
won
an
oscar
in
the
fugit
,
but
the
movi
make
good
use
of
hi
stone-fac
wit
.

thank
,
too
,
doubl
jeopardi
refrain
from
develop
a
romanc
between
libbi
and
travi
;
a
subplot
which
doubtlessli
would
have
interf
with
the
film
's
stori
.

thi
is
one
of
those
movi
where
cop
are
the
bad
guy
,
and
I
took
a
sort
of
sick
pleasur
in
that
.

the
sheer
anarchi
of
the
proceed
wa
noth
short
of
wonder
,
as
ashley
judd
kick
the
crap
out
of
everi
author
figur
in
the
book
.

after
all
the
idealist
hollywood
featur
featur
hero
cop
,
deft
fbi
agent
and
the
virtu
of
the
american
legal
system
,
it
's
great
to
see
a
movi
that
doe
n't
so
much
demonstr
their
fallaci
as
it
delight
in
their
failur
.

doubl
jeopardi
is
realli
good
,
but
it
is
n't
the
kind
of
good
that
is
rememb
or
recogn
with
award
.

It
's
one
of
those
movi
better
view
with
the
brain
turn
off
,
otherwis
,
your
brain
will
be
busi
ruin
your

thi
is
a
thriller
that
is
n't
concern
with
be
smart
or
plausibl
.

instead
it
divert
all
attent
to
the
action
,
which
,
thi
year
,
is
second
to
none
.
