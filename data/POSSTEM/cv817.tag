showgirl
is
the
second
major
outing
for
the
product
team
of
pual
verhoeven
,
director
,
and
joe
eszterha
,
writer
.

their
last
effort
,
basic
instinct
,
play
like
the
most
sumptuou
of
classic
hitchcock
,
with
a
dash
of
raw
sex
and
sensual
that
made
it
come
across
with
a
hit
like
curry-sp
tabasco
sauc
;
a
dish
not
to
everyon
's
tast
,
but
certainli
a
well-craft
movi
.

possibl
that
movi
's
greatest
strength
wa
that
the
most
import
event
happen
offstag
,
prior
to
the
movi
,
dure
the
movi
,
and
after
the
movi
...
and
that
,
after
bring
all
the
plotlin
togeth
neatli
,
it
left
the
viewer
with
full
knowledg
of
what
*
would
*
happen
in
the
charact
'
futur
,
so
there
wa
no
need
to
film
it
.

there
wa
actual
about
four
hour
'
worth
of
screen
stori
there
,
but
eszterha
found
way
to
get
it
all
on-screen
in
two
,
by
lead
hi
audienc
into
analyz
what
wa
realli
go
on
;
and
by
still
hold
their
interest
with
clever
misdirect
and
fals
trail
.

the
major
element
that
made
basic
instinct
work
so
well
are
present
in
showgirl
.

We
have
attract
,
sympathet
,
but
still
highli
repel
charact
;
we
have
show
for
the
eye
and
the
ear
,
plotlin
that
play
on
sever
level
,
we
have
beauti
delin
charact
who
are
drawn
from
life
and
veri
believ
,
and
we
have
a
stori
of
an
innoc
-lrb-
who
may
not
be
so
innoc
-rrb-
who
's
tri
to
play
straight
,
tri
to
improv
her
station
in
life
,
who
slip
into
behav
the
way
those
around
her
do
...
but
recov
with
a
flourish
,
and
quit
a
winner
.

In
thi
sens
,
the
movi
is
a
bit
of
a
departur
for
verhoeven
,
who
's
not
known
for
treat
hi
charact
well
;
but
nomi
,
the
part
play
by
elizabeth
berkley
,
definit
opt
out
of
the
game
in
a
posit
way
,
and
we
're
left
feel
good
about
her
futur
.

thi
is
not
one
of
the
great
movi
,
but
it
's
far
better
than
we
'd
been
led
to
expect
by
all
the
neg
pre-releas
public
.

verhoeven
got
hi
first
oscar
nomin
in
1971
,
and
in
the
last
quarter-centuri
ha
push
farther
and
farther
,
experi
with
the
socially-accept
limit
to
movie-mak
.

hi
most
recent
three
movi
,
robocop
,
total
recal
,
and
basic
instinct
,
have
been
a
progress
of
back-door
access
to
american
cultur
,
move
from
the
fantast
through
the
mere
psychot
to
the
underli
basic
drive
;
and
now
he
's
explor
the
sleez
.

thi
movi
may
be
the
first
movi
ever
made
for
which
the
director
's
contract
contain
a
specif
provis
that
he
would
not
have
to
deliv
an
R
rate
movi
.

-lrb-
verhoeven
had
to
cut
sever
part
of
basic
instinct
to
get
an
R
rate
,
although
hi
origin
version
is
avail
on
video
.
-rrb-

mani
review
have
taken
the
politically-correct
stanc
that
ani
movi
which
use
nake
ladi
as
sceneri
is
a
bad
thing
;
but
they
miss
the
fact
that
thi
movi
is
not
about
nake
ladi
,
it
's
about
peopl
in
an
environ
where
nake
ladi
are
common
,
and
whi
such
an
environ
should
exist
.

It
's
about
the
scum
who
use
other
peopl
as
power-trip
toy
,
and
the
need
to
escap
their
power
.

It
's
about
a
world
where
sex
is
noth
and
normal
human
valu
do
n't
pertain
;
and
the
lack
of
sexual
excit
and
passion
heat
in
even
the
most
blatant
scene
is
someth
of
an
accomplish
.

An
nc-17
movi
which
is
n't
sexual
excit
say
a
great
deal
about
the
phoni
and
empti
of
a
social
stratum
where
sex
ha
been
rob
of
ani
kind
of
beauti
,
power
,
or
valu
.

the
one
scene
in
the
movi
that
*
could
*
have
been
a
good
sex
scene
,
berkley
and
maclachlan
in
a
swim
pool
,
is
not
excit
,
becaus
by
then
we
alreadi
know
hi
charact
is
a
callou
manipul
.

If
anyth
,
it
's
a
rape
scene
with
a
victim
who
's
been
dupe
into
cooper
.

you
do
n't
make
a
movi
about
the
histori
of
black
peopl
in
america
without
use
a
few
black
actor
;
you
do
n't
make
a
movi
about
world
war
II
without
a
few
gun
go
off
and
a
few
peopl
get
kill
;
and
you
do
n't
make
a
movi
about
la
vega
showgirl
without
show
a
few
la
vega
showgirl
...
and
in
an
aw
lot
of
vega
show
,
an
aw
lot
of
ladi
wear
veri
littl
cloth
.

thi
is
a
legitim
portray
of
a
rather
seami
side
of
the
entertain
industri
,
in
a
town
where
sex
is
simpli
a
negoti
commod
.

showgirl
de-glamor
the
la
vega
show
and
sex
industri
with
great
effect
.

nomi
is
play
,
in
a
veri
good
perform
,
by
elizabeth
berkley
,
who
give
us
a
solid
pictur
of
a
woman
with
limit
talent
who
's
at
the
end
of
her
rope
,
desper
to
live
a
life
better
than
the
one
she
's
known
.

she
ha
noth
to
market
except
her
bodi
and
her
limit
danc
abil
,
and
is
tri
desper
not
to
to
be
a
hooker
,
tri
to
be
someth
better
than
she
seem
destin
to
be
.

when
nomi
realiz
she
's
gone
too
far
for
too
littl
,
she
catch
herself
just
in
time
to
save
the
most
essenti
part
of
who
she
want
to
be
.

gina
rivera
play
molli
,
a
dressmak
and
costum
who
befriend
nomi
,
provid
her
with
what
may
be
the
one
solid
,
posit
relationship
in
nomi
's
entir
life
.

molli
is
the
one
who
make
the
differ
,
and
provid
the
role
model
and
framework
nomi
need
to
verifi
the
valu
system
she
'll
be
use
for
the
rest
of
her
life
,
and
nomi
's
feel
for
molli
are
the
spur
that
forc
nomi
's
decis
.

gina
gershon
play
cristal
,
an
age
,
but
still
veri
attract
star
dancer
,
a
reflex
competit
manipul
who
's
becom
a
villai
by
intern
the
etho
of
the
crook
and
scum
around
her
.

gershon
play
cristal
as
a
cross
between
ava
gardner
and
raquel
welch
;
a
fade
talent
made
bitter
by
self-awar
.

her
charact
is
veri
well
drawn
and
perform
;
in
a
major
scene
in
a
hospit
room
,
she
acknowledg
what
she
is
,
and
,
in
essenc
,
pass
the
torch
to
nomi
.

the
relationship
between
the
two
of
them
is
the
most
honest
one
in
the
movi
,
and
provid
part
of
the
impetu
nomi
need
to
follow
a
differ
path
.

It
is
no
accid
that
the
three
import
part
in
thi
movi
are
women
of
differ
stripe
;
molli
is
an
honest
,
hard-work
person
who
mean
well
,
and
nearli
die
becaus
she
confus
the
glitter
and
the
imag
with
realiti
.

cristal
is
a
talent
dancer
who
's
compromis
her
ideal
and
sold
herself
to
be
a
co-oper
part
of
the
system
,
exchang
self-respect
for
the
speci
of
stardom
that
can
be
had
in
la
vega
.

nomi
believ
she
can
make
it
without
sell
herself
,
succumb
to
a
degre
,
and
then
realiz
she
can
make
it
without
sell
herself
,
and
doe
n't
need
la
vega
or
it
brand
of
``
stardom
.
''

the
male
part
in
thi
movi
are
simpli
prop
;
they
exist
onli
to
demonstr
and
explic
the
cultur
milieu
against
which
showgirl
exist
.

kyle
maclachlan
,
whose
singl
best
previou
work
wa
as
an
inhumanli
emotionless
cop
in
the
hidden
,
give
us
a
nice
reptilian
bit
of
pond
scum
on
two
leg
,
camouflag
as
a
nice
guy
.

glenn
plummer
play
a
dancer
who
's
work
as
a
bellboy
,
and
provid
a
bit
of
altern
perspect
.

plummer
's
charact
is
the
onli
one
in
the
movi
who
's
maintain
an
interest
in
danc
as
a
perform
art
,
but
even
he
's
succumb
to
the
cult
of
manipul
.

plummer
's
charact
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
sympathet
male
charact
in
the
whole
movi
.

some
of
jost
vacano
's
cinematographi
is
fantast
,
and
one
particular
delin
of
nomi
's
charact
alter
,
a
no-dialog
scene
use
noth
but
color
chang
in
the
light
,
is
utterli
terrifi
.

thi
movi
is
rate
nc-17
due
to
languag
,
sexual
situat
,
full
frontal
nuditi
,
violenc
,
and
probabl
the
costum
as
well
.

I
do
n't
see
a
way
thi
particular
stori
could
have
been
told
well
without
it
,
and
I
regard
it
as
a
legitim
exercis
in
movie-mak
.

but
do
n't
go
see
it
if
you
're
not
in
a
tough
mood
;
the
onli
person
it
's
possibl
to
like
in
thi
movi
end
up
in
an
i.c.u.
on
life
support
,
and
there
is
probabl
not
one
charact
in
thi
movi
you
'd
enjoy
meet
in
person
.
