I
did
not
read
the
novel
by
thoma
hardi
,
``
jude
the
obscur
,
''
hi
final
novel
-lrb-
final
becaus
thi
film
creat
such
an
outrag
that
he
never
wrote
again-se
:
I
did
do
some
research
on
it
-rrb-
about
a
man
who
is
plagu
with
bad
luck
throughout
hi
entir
life
.

but
,
after
watch
the
movi
,
I
can
imagin
how
incred
depress
it
is
.

``
jude
''
is
a
satir
film
from
start
to
finish
about
societi
's
way
of
spit
out
and
chew
up
those
unwant
in
it
system
,
but
what
's
remark
is
how
timeless
thi
film
is
.

the
film
take
place
in
the
late
19th
centuri
-lrb-
or
earli
20th-wasn
'
t
realli
sure
-rrb-
,
but
it
stori
could
even
be
retold
today
in
modern
form
,
although
it
'd
be
kinda
differ
-lrb-
a
given
-rrb-
.

It
tell
the
stori
of
jude
-lrb-
christoph
eccleston-th

In

.

after

-rrb-
becaus
they

liter
-rrb-
but
did
not
ultim
share
anyth
in

,
he
move
away
to
a
town
with
a
giant
univers
,
with
a
chanc
to
learn
more
,
and
get
ahead
in
life
.

take

but
when
he

hi
applic
for
the
school

,
he
is
bluntli
told

anoth
reason
for
go
to
thi
town
wa
becaus
someon
in
hi
famili
live
there
:
sue
-lrb-
kate
winslet
-rrb-
,
hi
cousin
and
a
veri
intellig
but
kinda
mischevi
young
woman
who
want
to
be
a
school
teacher
.

she
and
jude
click
eventu
and
becom
veri

friend
,
so
much
that
when
she
spend
the
night
at
hi
flat
after
run
from
her
apprentic
teacher
job
-lrb-
for
none
other
than
phillotson
at
the
local
school
-rrb-
,
there
are
rumor
that
she
and
jude
did
some
nasti
busi
-lrb-
nudg
nudg
-rrb-
.

sever
twist
turn
in
the
storylin
,
and
eventu
jude
and
sue
do
do
some
nasti
busi
-lrb-
an
interest
scene
,
to
say
the
least
...
-rrb-
,
and
are
soon
born
into
a
controversi
non-wedlock
,
as
she
eventu
give
birth
to
their
babi
,
and
jude
inherit
hi
son
from
arabella
,
who
turn
up
again
after
awhil
.

becaus
they
are
n't
marri
,
and
becaus
they
're
cousin
,
they
run
into
problem
with
everi
place
they
go
to
,
carri
around
two
children
everywher
,
and
onli
stay
in
lodg
for
a
veri
brief
period
of
time
,
then
move
on
.

If
you
did
n't
think
thi
wa
harsh
enough
,
wait
till
you
see
what
happen
later
on
...
the
sad
truth
is
that
jude
is
one
of
the
miser
peopl
who
can
never
get
ani
luck
in
thi
world
.

He
will
never
gain
ani
true
happi
,
and
ani
happi
that
happen
to
him
will
be
fleet
,
and
will
probabl
bring
more
horribl
instanc
to
hi
life
.

part
of
it
is
hi
fault-h
's
too
optimist
,
and
too
gullibl
.

but
societi
ha
a
way
of
take
these
peopl
,
and
hurt
them
until
their
death
.

the
end
of
``
jude
''
is
bleak
becaus
it
ha
to
be
-lrb-
although
I
hear
the
end
of
the
novel
is
even
worse-guess
I
'll
have
to
read
it
now
-rrb-
.

``
jude
''
offer
a
satir
view
on
societi
's
cruelti
,
but
show
no
way
of
cure
thi
,
and
thank
heaven
it
doe
n't
.

there
's
no
way
to
relinquish
the
selfish
of
societi
,
and
ani
solut
would
be
too
small
to
cure
such
a
mass
problem
.

satir
ha
alway
been
one
of
the
few
way
of
chang
certain
peopl
's
mind
,
and
that
's
what
``
jude
''
is
.

sure
,
it
's
one
hell
of
a
downer
,
but
it
need
to
be
.

the
film
also
posess
two
fantast
perform
from
it
two
lead
,
and
some
good
support
work
along
with
it
.

christoph
eccleston
-lrb-
slightli
resembl
richard
edson
with
hi
new
look
and
dumb
express
-rrb-
play
jude
wonder
,
sometim
bring
a
big
dumb
smile
to
hi
face
,
and
make
him
kind
of
child-lik
at
other
time
.

kate
winslet
,
in
a
pre
-
``
titan
''
perform
,
is
brilliant
,
nail
everi
psych
of
her
charact
,
and
creat
someon
who
's
troubl
but
veri
seduct
with
her
person
.

kate
may
be
the
best
actress
in
her
age
group
-lrb-
if
you
do
n't
believ
me
,
see
``
titan
,
''
branagh
's
``
hamlet
,
''
``
sens
and
sensibl
,
''
and
``
heavenli
creatur
,
''
the
latter
one
be
my
favorit
perform
of
her
-rrb-
.

In
the
support
role
,
liam
cunningham
is
a
wonder
flaw
teacher
,
expos
all
hi
bad
part
,
but
ultim
be
a
pretti
good
person
;
and
rachel
griffith
is
wonder
immatur
as
jude
's
wife
,
whom
he
never
divorc
.

``
jude
''
move
at
a
veri
slow
pace
,
and
keep
taunt
it
viewer
with
chanc
of
happi
for
it
protagonist
,
which
would
drive
some
peopl
nut
.

but
those
who
appreci
good
social
commentari
with
their
film
,
no
matter
how
slow
or
downright
depress
they
are
-lrb-
thi
one
is
both
-rrb-
will
appreci
``
jude
,
''
though
I
doubt
anyon
truli
enjoy
it
.
