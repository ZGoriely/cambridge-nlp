the
result
is
a
movi
that
is
a

point

second

more

No

it

than

which
is
a
shame
,
becaus

I
recommend
a
second
view
simpli
to
get
the
flavor
of
the
frequent
iron
foreshadow
in
the
open
part
of
the
movi
.

_

from
the
love
stori
between
jane

-lrb-
mol
-rrb-
and
dougla
hall
-lrb-
bierko
-rrb-
,
as
well
as
the
close
friendship
between
dougla
hall
and
hannon
fuller
.

In
that
sens
it
is
more
akin
to
_
gattaca
_
than
_
the
matrix
_
,
which
,
for
all
of
it
cute
philosoph
byplay
,
is
an
adolesc
movi
with
no
emot
depth
whatsoev
.

the
moment
when
jane
fuller
confess
her
love
for
dougla
hall
is
at
onc
satisfi
,
wrench
and
intellectu
challeng
.

In
it
final
moment
the
film
even
take
on
itself
,
when
david
,
jane
's
husband
,
who
ha
come
to
enjoy
kill
,
accus
her
of
be
the
sick
one
.

although
there
is
a
victori
for
the
lead
charact
,
thi
resolut
suggest
a
disturb
element
of
fantasi
in
jane
,
and
thu
a
deep-seat
charact
flaw
.

In
fact
,
hannon
fuller
's
activ
in
the
simul
world
,
the
behavior
of
jane
's
husband
,
and
the
effect
of
enter
the
simul
on
dougla
hall
all
hint
at
similar
issu
with
those
charact
.

thi
is
not
a
film
of
good
peopl
beset
from
without
by
great
evil
.

the
tragedi
is
not
in
their
star
,
but
in
themselv
.

the
major
actor
,
all
of
whom
are
requir
to
play
two
or
even

,
perform

well

,
doe
a

her
voic
,
howev
,
lack
the
necessari
weight
at
time
.

thi
could
be
becaus
she
wa
given
the
worst
line
in
a
movi
whose
major
weak
is
the
script
.

some
minor
flaw
,
hairlin
crack
in
fine
porcelain
,
appear
in
place
.

there
are
one
or
two
instanc
of

the
script
take

off
the
film
's
climax
.

the
atmospher
becom
too
claustrophob
at
time
-lrb-
yet
,
there
is
a
clue
there
too
-rrb-
.

one
wonder
if
even
after
two
decad
,
_
blade
runner
_
is
still
cast
it
long
shadow
over
sci-fi
film
.

one
can
see
a
group
of
suit
in
their
suit
,
wave
their
hand
imperi
at
director
like
the
emperor
in
_
amadeu
_
:
``
make
it
more
like_blad
runner
_
,
you
know
,
dark
and
raini
.
''

_
the
thirteen
floor
_
is
that
rare
except
among
hollywood
movi
:
a
,
rich
,
emot
satisfi
,
intellig
sci-fi
movi
.

and
yet
,
ultim
,
it
prove
the
suit
right
.

for
when
good
sci-fi
is
made
,
where
is
the
SF
commun
turn
out
in
drove
to
see
it
?

If
we
do
n't
support
great
SF
,
who
will
?
