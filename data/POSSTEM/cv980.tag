play
grumpi
weatherman
phil
conner
,
who
,
everi
year
,
is
sent
to
punxsutawney
,
p.a
,
to
report
on
groundhog
day
.

the
groundhog
day
ceremoni
involv
a
groundhog
be
lift
out
of
a
box
,
and
if
he
dose
n't
see
a
shadow
,
it
will
be
an
earli
spring
.

phil
realli
hate
the
ceremoni
,
and
not
even
hi
produc
rita
-lrb-
macdowel
-rrb-
can
chang
hi
mind
.

howev
,
fate
ha
a
cruel
trick
for
phil
,
and
he
start
re-liv
groundhog
day
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
,
until
he
gradual
like
it
,
and
rita
fall
in
love
with
him
.

groundhog
day
is
a
well
written
,
totatli
unoffens
and
funni
comedi
.

the
screenwrit
,
director
rami
and
danni
rubin
,
have
written
a
funni
,
warm
,
but
never
overli
senitment
comedi
.

although
the
idea
of
a
day
repeat
over
and
over
may
sound
tediou
,
there
are
enough
good
joke
to
hold
the
audienc
attent
throughout
the
whole
film
.

rami
's
direct
also
help
,
and
although
he
dose
n't
tri
ani
flash
director
trick
,
the
film
is
direct
well
enough
,
and
the
joke
are
set
up
well
.

and
the
edit
is
also
good
,
especi
when
it
show
one
part
of
the
day
over
,
and
over
again
,
such
as
when
phil
tri
to
have
the
perfect
night
with
rita
.

the
perform
are
also
excel
.

bill
murray
is
great
fun
,
and
hi
transist
from
cynic
to
happi
is
smooth
,
and
deliv
hi
line
in
hi
usual
smari
style
.

andi
macdowel
is
good
as
rita
,
although
sometim
she
is
just
a
littl
bit
too
sweet
in
some
part
of
the
film
.

there
is
chemistri
between
the
two
lead
,
thank
,
otherwis
the
whole
film
would
probabl
fall
part
.

chri
elliot
,
as
the
cameraman
larri
,
is
also
funni
,
although
you
have
to
like
hi
goofi
style
,
otherwis
you
are
realli
go
to
hate
him
throughout
thi
film
,
and
it
will
lower
your
enjoy
of
the
film
overal
.

the
support
cast
are
n't
bad
either
,
with
stephen
tobolowski
hillar
as
phil
old
school
mate
ned
ryanson
,
and
even
director
rami
pop
up
as
a
neurologist
.

In
fact
,
there
is
not
one
dud
perform
in
thi
film
,
and
even
the
groundhog
get
a
funni
scene
involv
a
car
chase
.

overal
,
there
is
realli
noth
wrong
with
groundhog
day
at
all
.

It
almost
seem
perfect
.

howev
,
the
film
can
get
a
bit
soppi
sometim
,
and
some
peopl
may
get
irrit
by
the
day
repeat
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
.

also
,
there
's
not
much
of
an
music
score
,
and
the
music
there
is
is
pretti
bad
.

but
these
critic
hardli
affect
the
audienc
enjoy
at
all
.

overal
,
then
,
groundhog
day
is
a
funni
,
smart
,
and
also
ha
some
room
in
there
for
some
heart
.

An
excel
comedi
.
