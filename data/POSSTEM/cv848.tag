OF
good

is
an
eastwood-direct
film
clint
is

and
it
's
damn
good
.

adapt

where
peopl
walk

.

and
that
's
just
the
mayor
.

like
all
great
movi
,
midnight
IN
the
garden
ha
a
lot
of
funni
moment
that
spring
from
the
charact
themselv
,
and
not
from
some
contriv
,
juvenil
intrus
.

the
act
,
from
big-tim
star
john
cusack
and
kevin
spacey
,
is
as
good
as
you
'd
expect
,
but
it
's
the
support
stabl
that
give
the
movi
it
offbeat
charm
.

cusack

lot
of
food
,
beverag
and
gunplay

ye
,
an
employe
of
spacey
's
ha
a
huge
argument
in
front
of
cusack
and
later
turn
up
dead
.

It
seem
like
a
simpl
matter
of
self-defens
--
the
guy
threaten
spacey
,
shot
at
him
,
miss
,
then
spacey
took
him
out
--
but
be
a
movi
,
there
's
much
more
to
it
than
that
,
and
cusack
decid
to
stay
in
town
and
write
a
book
about
the
murder
,
a
book
which
will
eventu
becom
a
movi
he
will
star
in
.

the
weird
circl
of
entertain
.

thi
is
where
the
stabl
of
support
charact
come
in
.

there
's
the
requisit
sexi
woman
-lrb-
alison
``
nepotist
's
daughter

eastwood
-rrb-
,
the
strang
piano
player
,
the
voodoo

and
the
transvestit
.

miss
chabli
deserv
a
paragraph
of
his/her
own
,
as
the
stealer
of
everi
scene
she
appear
in
--
what
would
thi
movi
be
without
the
castilian
scene
and
her
testimoni
?

chabli
,
play
herself
,
is
five
time
funnier
than
reign
drag
queen
rupaul
,
but
never
seem
exploit
as
the
movi
's
comic
relief
or
out
of
place
in
a
basic
seriou
movi
.

there
are
also
a
fair
share
of
courtroom
scene
,
which
these
day
almost
never
seem
welcom
in
a
movi
,
but
even
here
clint
manag
to
keep
the
movi
fascin
.

certainli
the
character
of
the
judg
and
spacey
's
lawyer
both
help
immens
,
as
doe
have
the
fly-guy
as
the
juri
's
foreman
.

It
's
here
we
realiz
the
case
boil
down
to
an
indict
of
spacey
's
homosexu
.

ye
,
spacey
had
a
sexual
relationship
with
the
dead
man
--
befor
he
shot
him
,
of
cours
.

midnight
IN
the
garden
OF
good
and
evil
is
n't
a
classic
,
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
celebrity-direct
,
true-stori
best-sel
adapt
out
there
.

likewis
,
no
one
from
thi
movi
will
be
get
ani
oscar
nomin
,
but
the
perform
are
all
great
.

In
fact
,
I
'd
almost
recommend
that
the
academi
add
a
best
support
transvestit
categori
.
