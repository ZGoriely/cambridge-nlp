the
posit

happi
medium
between
the
heavy-handed

pocahonta
and
the
hunchback
OF
notr

On
the
other
hand
,
the
studio
is
pull
out
all
the
stop
on
plot
clich
and
cheap
laugh
,
sever
step
down
from

but
mulan

a
step
in
the
right
direct
and
disney

best
anim
featur
sinc
the
lion

after
give
nativ
american
a
turn
in
pocahonta
,
disney
ha
decid
to
turn
a
movi
over
to
the
asian
.

mulan
is
set
in
feudal
china
and
featur
the
ever-popular
heroin
who
march
To
A
differ
drum
and
want
To
Do

that
's
what
we
find

but
that
kind

when
they
find
mulan
ha
stolen
her
father
's
uniform
and
sword

.

the
movi
in
a
nutshel
is
about
the
stuggl
of
be
a

.

It
should
have
been
call
g.i.

.

mulan
call
on
her
ancestor
for
help
.

they
decid
to
summon
the

but
a
mini
dragon
name
mushu
screw

up
.

voic
by
eddi
murphi
,
mushu
continu
the
tradit
of
cute
talk
anim
sidekick
who
do
more
slapstick
harm
than
good
for
their
human
charg
.

murphi
's
perform
is
a
direct
descend
of
robin
william
in
aladdin
--
lot
of
wisecrack
and
ad-lib
and
even
an
introductori
song
about
how
much
fun
they
're
go
to
have
.

you
ai
n't
never
had
a
friend
like
mushu
.

speak
of
song
,
mulan
doe
n't
have
too
mani
of
them
,
which
is
a
plu
with
a
stori
like
thi
.

disney
song
about
war
probabl
would
n't
go
over
too
well
-lrb-
``
heigh
ho

heigh
ho
,
it
's
off
to
war
I
go
...
''
-rrb-
,
and
the
one
they
do
have
are
n't
memor

the
best
of
the
bunch
,
sad
to
say
,
is
``
Be
a
man
,
''
the
requisit
basic
train
montag
song
.

ye
,
even
in
mediev
china
,
they
had
to
run
through
that
web
of
car
tire
befor
they
were
readi
for

It
make
me
wonder
,
ha
there
ever
been
a
music
montag
in
a
movi
that
's
end
badli
?

I
onli
wish
real-lif
problem
could
be
solv
in
two
minut
with
a
peppi
montag
.

for
the
curiou
,
mulan
doe
pass
for
a
man
in
the
armi
despit
look
like
a
girl
.

all
she
doe
to
transform
herself
is
cut
her
hair
to
a
sexi
shoulder-length
,
talk
macho
and
slap
guy
on
the
butt
,
as
wa
male
custom
a
thousand
year
ago
in
china
.

the
decept
fool
everyon
but
the
audienc
,
who
think
she
might
be
abl
to
pass
for
a
12-year-old
boy
,
at
best
.

but
she
doe
manag
to
strike
the
biggest
blow
to
the
hun
armi
,
led
by
a
big
,
evil-ey
attilla-look
monster
.

As
a
villain
,
the
head
of
the
hun
is
menac
,
evil
and
entir
forgett
.

I
saw
the
movi
yesterday
and
I
do
n't
rememb
the
man
's
name
.

mulan
is
a
good
movi
.

the
anim
of
the
charact
themselv
is
n't
as
rich
as
it
could
and
should
be
,
but
there
are
some
amaz
battlefield
