In

the
movi
wear
it
ambit
proudli
on

all

for
some
of
the
most
bone-rattl
shoot-out

punch-out
film
.

they
are
better
seen
than
describ
and
are
reason
enough
to
see
the
film
:
one
jaw-drop
scene
ha
van

-lrb-
van
damm
is
a
good
,
dextrou
athlet
and
fighter
,
but
he
is
often
upstag
.
-rrb-

there
are
other
nice
touch
.

stavro
and
quinn
both
want
the
same
thing
:
to
retir
in
peac
with
their
famili
.

that
ambit
tie
them
togeth
in
variou
way
,
and
also
human
them
a
bit
.

one
of
the
thing
about
HK
action
movi
is
that
there
's
alway
some
form
of
human
element
,
and
that
's
carri
over
into
thi
movi
as
well
.

It
give
weight
to
scene
that
would
otherwis
be
forgett
.

also
good
is
denni
rodman
,
play
a
weapon
dealer
name
yaz
--
a
charact
who
stick
out
like
a
fist
of
broken
finger
and
who
is
funni
just
stand
there
.

rodman
is
natur
on
screen
;
he
's
fun
to
watch
,
especi
when
sling
bad
guy
like
basketbal
,
and
deserv
to
get
a
movi
of
hi
own
,
base
on
what
's
seen
here
:
a
lightweight
,
fast-mov
entertain
that
showcas
all
of
it
piec
